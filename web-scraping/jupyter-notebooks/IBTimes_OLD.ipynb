       "  'HDFC Ltd, India\\'s largest housing financing firm, will merge with HDFC Bank, the country\\'s largest private lender, to form a banking behemoth in one of the largest mergers in corporate history. According to stock exchange filings by the companies, HDFC Bank would be 100% held by public shareholders once the merger is completed, and existing HDFC shareholders will own 41% of the bank. For every 25 HDFC Bank shares owned, each HDFC shareholder will receive 42 HDFC Bank shares.\"This is a merger of equals. We believe that the housing finance business is poised to grow in leaps and bounds due to the implementation of RERA, infrastructure status to the housing sector, and government initiatives like affordable housing for all, amongst others.\" Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC Ltd.Plan for the mergerHDFC Limited, India\\'s largest housing finance company with Rs 5.26 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and a market capitalization of Rs 4.44 trillion, will merge with HDFC Bank, India\\'s largest private sector bank by assets with a market capitalization of Rs 8.35 trillion, according to the transaction structure. HDFC Limited\\'s subsidiaries and partners will likewise be transferred to HDFC Bank.How will the merger help HDFCThe HDFC-HDFC Bank merger will reduce the risk of a single product failure and increase the merged entity\\'s asset variety. In contrast to the current assignment route, the combined entity will be able to offer mortgage products seamlessly, according to Deepak Parekh, who spoke at a press conference today. Moreover, When costs are reduced, the merged firm enjoys cost savings and is value accretive for both HDFC and HDFC Bank shareholders.It is to be noted that the merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank has been in the news for some time. In reality, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh stated in 2015 that his company would explore merging with HDFC Bank if the circumstances were favourable. However, due to the parent\\'s decision to put the merger on hold, the wait for the merger grew longer. According to Parekh, the combination makes sense as long as shareholders do not lose wealth.'),\n",

A video of Hanuman Chalisa playing on loudspeaker outside MNS office in Ghatkopar in Mumbai has now gone viral on social media. This not only came shortly after Raj\\'s remarks, but also on the first day of Ramadan, which is religiously celebrated by Muslims.Raj triggers political debateThackeray\\'s remarks didn\\'t go down well with the masses, triggering a political outrage.His demand from the MVA government to immediately ban loudspeakers at mosques or he would counter them by playing Hanuman Chalisa at double volume near the mosques, was met with heavy criticism. He even urged the gathering of \\'Hindus\\' \"not to forget\" his sermons, give an opportunity to the MNS to rule the state 2024 and help take it towards progress.Top MVA leaders starting with Sena MP Sanjay Raut, NCP chief Pawar, Deputy CM Ajit Pawar, Supriya Sule, Congress\\' Nana Patole, Ashok Chavan, Atul Londhe, ex-Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar and others clobbered Raj Thackeray for his unbridled remarks.Surprisingly, Asaduddin Owaisi, President of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) - which recently sought an alliance with the MVA but was spurned - issued a gag order on his party from reacting to the MNS chief\\'s comments.The MNS spokesperson Sandip Deshpande took strong umbrage at the barrage of criticism and calling Raj as the BJP\\'s \\'C Team\\', while party activists launched an agitation playing high-decibel Hanuman Chalisa on loudspeakers\\xa0near a mosque in Ghatkopar, giving tense moments to the police on the first day of the holy month of Ramzan.'),\n",

An IndiGo passenger shared his side of the story on how his bag was swapped with another co-passenger, a common error when there are similar suitcases on the conveyer belt at the airport.Nandan Kumar, a Bengaluru-based software engineer, shared an interesting thread on how his luggage was swapped at the airport. After having failed to retrieve his luggage from a co-passenger, whose suitcase had landed in Kumar\\'s possession, he decided to take matters in his own hands. Not just that, in doing so, he claimed to have discovered a technical vulnerability in IndiGo\\'s system. The airline has since investigated the matter and released a statement in which IndiGo has assured that no breach took place.The claimIn a detailed thread, Kumar shared his ordeal of how his luggage got swapped at Bengaluru airport. He had been travelling from Patna to Bengaluru on an IndiGo flight, but he accidentally came home with someone else\\'s suitcase, which looked a lot like his own. After realising his bag had been swapped, he claims to have called IndiGo customer care and after \"a lot of wait\" and \"navigating through IndiGo IVR\", he got hold of one exec. But no resolution was reached as customer care couldn\\'t connect Kumar with the co-passenger with whom his suitcase had been swapped.After having waited a day, he tried to resolve the matter himself. He already had the co-passengers PNR from the bag tag, so he tried to use that to retrieve some contact information about the co-passenger from the IndiGo website, yet again to no avail.Hey @IndiGo6E ,Want to hear a story? And at the end of it I will tell you hole (technical vulnerability )in your system? #dev #bug #bugbounty ?? 1/nThat\\'s when he claims he accessed the website\\'s developer tools by pressing F12 and went through the network responses. To his surprise, he found the contact number and email address of the co-passenger. He managed to get through to the co-passenger, and even swapped the bags. In conclusion, he made three suggestions to IndiGo, based on his experience.Kumar\\'s thread went viral, with hundreds and thousands of RTs and Likes and comments. Many applauded his efforts and criticised IndiGo\\'s lax security on the website with regards to storing customer data.Due to the viral nature of the tweet thread, many major publications published articles that are suggestive of Kumar hacking the IndiGo website.Fact checkInternational Business Times\\xa0reviewed the claims made in the thread carefully and assessed the situation. We also reviewed the official response from IndiGo concerning this incident, which went viral on social media.Responding to the claims made by Kumar in the viral thread, IndiGo assured that there had been no breach in its systems.

The smart TV race is incomplete without OnePlus' participation, which has added some interesting additions since September of 2019. The latest entrant in the OnePlus smart TV product portfolio is the Y1S Edge, which caters to the demand of budget shoppers.If the OnePlus Y1S Edge caught your attention and you've been contemplating whether or not to buy it, you've arrived at the right place. In this review, we explore the good and the bad in the new OnePlus TV, helping you to make a purchase decision.Let us give you a brief about what the OnePlus Y1S Edge\\xa0has to offer:OnePlus\\xa0TV Y1S Edge is available for Rs 16,999 for the 32-inch model and Rs 27,999 for the bigger 43 inches.DesignKeeping in line with OnePlus tradition, the TV Y1S Edge brings a sense of premium-ness to the budget segment here. The bottom bezel has a metallic coating, the panel is sleek and the panel is bezel-less - all of which make for a modern look. For those who want to place the TV on the table, the stands are firmly placed to hold the TV Y1S Edge intact. The subtle OnePlus logo and the light indicator below add to the minimalistic look. Despite the plastic build of the TV (including the stands), it doesn't look cheap.On the back of the panel are Ethernet port, RF port, HDMI ports, USB, AV Input and Digital Audio output ports, all of them nicely tucked away. In this age of wireless connectivity, you'll use the ports only when there's a lack of an alternative. For everything else, there's Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0 support and OnePlus Connect 2.0.DisplayOnePlus TV Y1S Edge has a 43-inch panel with 1920x1080 resolution. The LED-backlit LCD panel renders good picture quality. There are a host of features packed inside to ensure you get a premium experience. There is support for HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG formats, which means your Netflix and YouTube binge-watching sessions are sorted. On the downside, you miss out on Dolby Vision.The default settings in the TV right out of the box will deliver the optimum viewing experience, but you can fine-tune display settings to your liking and you'll find the settings to be quite useful. The end result, you get a bright, sharp and vivid output. The OnePlus TV, at its affordable price range, is ideal for viewing HDR content.The Gamma Engine integration offers features like anti-aliasing, noise reduction and dynamic contrast, which are touted to offer a better experience, but you'll notice little difference. The OnePlus TV's colour palette is as good as you'd get on a budget TV, but the details and contrast levels are good. Overall, the viewing experience on the OnePlus TV Y1S Edge is well worth its buck.AudioOnePlus TV Y1S Edge comes with two speakers facing downwards, which are complemented by Dolby Audio. The speakers deliver an output of 24W, which gets loud enough to fill the room with clear vocals and bass. Low-frequency notes are often muffled, it's not something you cannot fix with an additional speaker or a soundbar. Or simply just crank up the volume, and you should be good to go, but the only disadvantage would be that all other sounds will get loud, too. Investing in an affordable soundbar won't hurt, but depending on the square footage of the room or living room, you can take a call on whether you really need it or not.User interface and featuresOnePlus TV Y1S Edge is powered by the latest OxygenPlay 2.0 based on Android 11, which bags a host of interesting and useful features. If you own a OnePlus smartphone, you're truly in for a treat. OnePlus has wonderfully built its ecosystem and seamless cross-device integration is worthy of applause.For instance, you can use your OnePlus smartphone to control most of your TV and even pair the OnePlus Buds as easily as you would with your phone. There's more, if you happen to own the OnePlus Watch, you can do some wizard tricks from your wrist. Like, if you have the habit of falling asleep in front of the TV, the Watch will inform the TV to shut down.The OnePlus Connect 2.0 app offers a host of connectivity features, including casting, taking screenshots and all this even when there's no Wi-Fi or mobile data to connect.OnePlus TV Y1S Edge can be controlled via the remote, and we did not notice any major lags and it appeared snappy. It's impressive how much a budget TV such as the Y1S Edge can do for its asking price. OnePlus is not tight-fisted about sharing the features it offers in its premium Q-range.Under the hood, the Y1S Edge has a quad-core MediaTek processor, 1GB RAM and 8GB storage, which is shared among the OS and apps. The overall performance is acceptable and the apps would launch reasonably quick.VerdictOnePlus TV Y1S Edge is a well-rounded smart TV, which can be a perfect addition as your secondary TV or even the primary one if you're looking for something on a budget. At Rs 27,999, it's definitely one of the better choices to go for. If you already have a OnePlus smartphone among other accessories by the brand, this new addition will be well worth its price. In fact, the ecosystem factor is what makes this TV more appealing than the competition, which can be fierce given the price range it competes.OnePlus TV Y1S has a premium and sleek design, good panel, and some excellent convenient features. The only issue would be that the OnePlus TV Y1S is treading in dangerous territory. There's some tough competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Redmi TVs in this very price range.\"),\n",

       "  \"OnePlus' foray into the smart TV space has been exciting as consumers now get to choose from a wide range of options. OnePlus Y1S Edge is another worthy mention in this category. Read our review here.\",\n",
       "  \"Only those shopping for a telly truly understands the myriad of options from various brands. From Samsung to Xiaomi, LG and beyond, there is a TV to suit every need and budget. The smart TV race is incomplete without OnePlus' participation, which has added some interesting additions since September of 2019. The latest entrant in the OnePlus smart TV product portfolio is the Y1S Edge, which caters to the demand of budget shoppers.If the OnePlus Y1S Edge caught your attention and you've been contemplating whether or not to buy it, you've arrived at the right place. In this review, we explore the good and the bad in the new OnePlus TV, helping you to make a purchase decision.Let us give you a brief about what the OnePlus Y1S Edge\\xa0has to offer:OnePlus\\xa0TV Y1S Edge is available for Rs 16,999 for the 32-inch model and Rs 27,999 for the bigger 43 inches.DesignKeeping in line with OnePlus tradition, the TV Y1S Edge brings a sense of premium-ness to the budget segment here. The bottom bezel has a metallic coating, the panel is sleek and the panel is bezel-less - all of which make for a modern look. For those who want to place the TV on the table, the stands are firmly placed to hold the TV Y1S Edge intact. The subtle OnePlus logo and the light indicator below add to the minimalistic look. Despite the plastic build of the TV (including the stands), it doesn't look cheap.On the back of the panel are Ethernet port, RF port, HDMI ports, USB, AV Input and Digital Audio output ports, all of them nicely tucked away. In this age of wireless connectivity, you'll use the ports only when there's a lack of an alternative. For everything else, there's Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0 support and OnePlus Connect 2.0.DisplayOnePlus TV Y1S Edge has a 43-inch panel with 1920x1080 resolution. The LED-backlit LCD panel renders good picture quality. There are a host of features packed inside to ensure you get a premium experience. There is support for HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG formats, which means your Netflix and YouTube binge-watching sessions are sorted. On the downside, you miss out on Dolby Vision.The default settings in the TV right out of the box will deliver the optimum viewing experience, but you can fine-tune display settings to your liking and you'll find the settings to be quite useful. The end result, you get a bright, sharp and vivid output. The OnePlus TV, at its affordable price range, is ideal for viewing HDR content.The Gamma Engine integration offers features like anti-aliasing, noise reduction and dynamic contrast, which are touted to offer a better experience, but you'll notice little difference. The OnePlus TV's colour palette is as good as you'd get on a budget TV, but the details and contrast levels are good. Overall, the viewing experience on the OnePlus TV Y1S Edge is well worth its buck.AudioOnePlus TV Y1S Edge comes with two speakers facing downwards, which are complemented by Dolby Audio. The speakers deliver an output of 24W, which gets loud enough to fill the room with clear vocals and bass. Low-frequency notes are often muffled, it's not something you cannot fix with an additional speaker or a soundbar. Or simply just crank up the volume, and you should be good to go, but the only disadvantage would be that all other sounds will get loud, too. Investing in an affordable soundbar won't hurt, but depending on the square footage of the room or living room, you can take a call on whether you really need it or not.User interface and featuresOnePlus TV Y1S Edge is powered by the latest OxygenPlay 2.0 based on Android 11, which bags a host of interesting and useful features. If you own a OnePlus smartphone, you're truly in for a treat. OnePlus has wonderfully built its ecosystem and seamless cross-device integration is worthy of applause.For instance, you can use your OnePlus smartphone to control most of your TV and even pair the OnePlus Buds as easily as you would with your phone. There's more, if you happen to own the OnePlus Watch, you can do some wizard tricks from your wrist. Like, if you have the habit of falling asleep in front of the TV, the Watch will inform the TV to shut down.The OnePlus Connect 2.0 app offers a host of connectivity features, including casting, taking screenshots and all this even when there's no Wi-Fi or mobile data to connect.OnePlus TV Y1S Edge can be controlled via the remote, and we did not notice any major lags and it appeared snappy. It's impressive how much a budget TV such as the Y1S Edge can do for its asking price. OnePlus is not tight-fisted about sharing the features it offers in its premium Q-range.Under the hood, the Y1S Edge has a quad-core MediaTek processor, 1GB RAM and 8GB storage, which is shared among the OS and apps. The overall performance is acceptable and the apps would launch reasonably quick.VerdictOnePlus TV Y1S Edge is a well-rounded smart TV, which can be a perfect addition as your secondary TV or even the primary one if you're looking for something on a budget. At Rs 27,999, it's definitely one of the better choices to go for. If you already have a OnePlus smartphone among other accessories by the brand, this new addition will be well worth its price. In fact, the ecosystem factor is what makes this TV more appealing than the competition, which can be fierce given the price range it competes.OnePlus TV Y1S has a premium and sleek design, good panel, and some excellent convenient features. The only issue would be that the OnePlus TV Y1S is treading in dangerous territory. There's some tough competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Redmi TVs in this very price range.\"),\n",

For every 25 HDFC Bank shares owned, each HDFC shareholder will receive 42 HDFC Bank shares.\"This is a merger of equals.

In contrast to the current assignment route, the combined entity will be able to offer mortgage products seamlessly, according to Deepak Parekh, who spoke at a press conference today. Moreover, When costs are reduced, the merged firm enjoys cost savings and is value accretive for both HDFC and HDFC Bank shareholders.It is to be noted that the merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank has been in the news for some time. In reality, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh stated in 2015 that his company would explore merging with HDFC Bank if the circumstances were favourable. However, due to the parent\\'s decision to put the merger on hold, the wait for the merger grew longer.

The speakers deliver an output of 24W, which gets loud enough to fill the room with clear vocals and bass. Low-frequency notes are often muffled, it's not something you cannot fix with an additional speaker or a soundbar. Or simply just crank up the volume, and you should be good to go, but the only disadvantage would be that all other sounds will get loud, too. Investing in an affordable soundbar won't hurt, but depending on the square footage of the room or living room, you can take a call on whether you really need it or not.User interface and featuresOnePlus TV Y1S Edge is powered by the latest OxygenPlay 2.0 based on Android 11, which bags a host of interesting and useful features. If you own a OnePlus smartphone, you're truly in for a treat. OnePlus has wonderfully built its ecosystem and seamless cross-device integration is worthy of applause.For instance, you can use your OnePlus smartphone to control most of your TV and even pair the OnePlus Buds as easily as you would with your phone. There's more, if you happen to own the OnePlus Watch, you can do some wizard tricks from your wrist. Like, if you have the habit of falling asleep in front of the TV, the Watch will inform the TV to shut down.The OnePlus Connect 2.0 app offers a host of connectivity features, including casting, taking screenshots and all this even when there's no Wi-Fi or mobile data to connect.OnePlus TV Y1S Edge can be controlled via the remote, and we did not notice any major lags and it appeared snappy. It's impressive how much a budget TV such as the Y1S Edge can do for its asking price. OnePlus is not tight-fisted about sharing the features it offers in its premium Q-range.Under the hood, the Y1S Edge has a quad-core MediaTek processor, 1GB RAM and 8GB storage, which is shared among the OS and apps. The overall performance is acceptable and the apps would launch reasonably quick.VerdictOnePlus TV Y1S Edge is a well-rounded smart TV, which can be a perfect addition as your secondary TV or even the primary one if you're looking for something on a budget. At Rs 27,999, it's definitely one of the better choices to go for. If you already have a OnePlus smartphone among other accessories by the brand, this new addition will be well worth its price. In fact, the ecosystem factor is what makes this TV more appealing than the competition, which can be fierce given the price range it competes.OnePlus TV Y1S has a premium and sleek design, good panel, and some excellent convenient features. The only issue would be that the OnePlus TV Y1S is treading in dangerous territory. There's some tough competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Redmi TVs in this very price range.\"),\n",

       "  \"Only those shopping for a telly truly understands the myriad of options from various brands. From Samsung to Xiaomi, LG and beyond, there is a TV to suit every need and budget. The smart TV race is incomplete without OnePlus' participation, which has added some interesting additions since September of 2019. The latest entrant in the OnePlus smart TV product portfolio is the Y1S Edge, which caters to the demand of budget shoppers.If the OnePlus Y1S Edge caught your attention and you've been contemplating whether or not to buy it, you've arrived at the right place. In this review, we explore the good and the bad in the new OnePlus TV, helping you to make a purchase decision.Let us give you a brief about what the OnePlus Y1S Edge\\xa0has to offer:OnePlus\\xa0TV Y1S Edge is available for Rs 16,999 for the 32-inch model and Rs 27,999 for the bigger 43 inches.DesignKeeping in line with OnePlus tradition, the TV Y1S Edge brings a sense of premium-ness to the budget segment here. The bottom bezel has a metallic coating, the panel is sleek and the panel is bezel-less - all of which make for a modern look. For those who want to place the TV on the table, the stands are firmly placed to hold the TV Y1S Edge intact. The subtle OnePlus logo and the light indicator below add to the minimalistic look. Despite the plastic build of the TV (including the stands), it doesn't look cheap.On the back of the panel are Ethernet port, RF port, HDMI ports, USB, AV Input and Digital Audio output ports, all of them nicely tucked away. In this age of wireless connectivity, you'll use the ports only when there's a lack of an alternative. For everything else, there's Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0 support and OnePlus Connect 2.0.DisplayOnePlus TV Y1S Edge has a 43-inch panel with 1920x1080 resolution. The LED-backlit LCD panel renders good picture quality. There are a host of features packed inside to ensure you get a premium experience. There is support for HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG formats, which means your Netflix and YouTube binge-watching sessions are sorted. On the downside, you miss out on Dolby Vision.The default settings in the TV right out of the box will deliver the optimum viewing experience, but you can fine-tune display settings to your liking and you'll find the settings to be quite useful. The end result, you get a bright, sharp and vivid output. The OnePlus TV, at its affordable price range, is ideal for viewing HDR content.The Gamma Engine integration offers features like anti-aliasing, noise reduction and dynamic contrast, which are touted to offer a better experience, but you'll notice little difference. The OnePlus TV's colour palette is as good as you'd get on a budget TV, but the details and contrast levels are good. Overall, the viewing experience on the OnePlus TV Y1S Edge is well worth its buck.AudioOnePlus TV Y1S Edge comes with two speakers facing downwards, which are complemented by Dolby Audio. The speakers deliver an output of 24W, which gets loud enough to fill the room with clear vocals and bass. Low-frequency notes are often muffled, it's not something you cannot fix with an additional speaker or a soundbar. Or simply just crank up the volume, and you should be good to go, but the only disadvantage would be that all other sounds will get loud, too. Investing in an affordable soundbar won't hurt, but depending on the square footage of the room or living room, you can take a call on whether you really need it or not.User interface and featuresOnePlus TV Y1S Edge is powered by the latest OxygenPlay 2.0 based on Android 11, which bags a host of interesting and useful features. If you own a OnePlus smartphone, you're truly in for a treat. OnePlus has wonderfully built its ecosystem and seamless cross-device integration is worthy of applause.For instance, you can use your OnePlus smartphone to control most of your TV and even pair the OnePlus Buds as easily as you would with your phone. There's more, if you happen to own the OnePlus Watch, you can do some wizard tricks from your wrist. Like, if you have the habit of falling asleep in front of the TV, the Watch will inform the TV to shut down.The OnePlus Connect 2.0 app offers a host of connectivity features, including casting, taking screenshots and all this even when there's no Wi-Fi or mobile data to connect.OnePlus TV Y1S Edge can be controlled via the remote, and we did not notice any major lags and it appeared snappy. It's impressive how much a budget TV such as the Y1S Edge can do for its asking price. OnePlus is not tight-fisted about sharing the features it offers in its premium Q-range.Under the hood, the Y1S Edge has a quad-core MediaTek processor, 1GB RAM and 8GB storage, which is shared among the OS and apps. The overall performance is acceptable and the apps would launch reasonably quick.VerdictOnePlus TV Y1S Edge is a well-rounded smart TV, which can be a perfect addition as your secondary TV or even the primary one if you're looking for something on a budget. At Rs 27,999, it's definitely one of the better choices to go for. If you already have a OnePlus smartphone among other accessories by the brand, this new addition will be well worth its price. In fact, the ecosystem factor is what makes this TV more appealing than the competition, which can be fierce given the price range it competes.OnePlus TV Y1S has a premium and sleek design, good panel, and some excellent convenient features. The only issue would be that the OnePlus TV Y1S is treading in dangerous territory. There's some tough competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Redmi TVs in this very price range.\"),\n",

       "  \"OnePlus' foray into the smart TV space has been exciting as consumers now get to choose from a wide range of options. OnePlus Y1S Edge is another worthy mention in this category. Read our review here.\",\n",
       "  \"Only those shopping for a telly truly understands the myriad of options from various brands. From Samsung to Xiaomi, LG and beyond, there is a TV to suit every need and budget. The smart TV race is incomplete without OnePlus' participation, which has added some interesting additions since September of 2019. The latest entrant in the OnePlus smart TV product portfolio is the Y1S Edge, which caters to the demand of budget shoppers.If the OnePlus Y1S Edge caught your attention and you've been contemplating whether or not to buy it, you've arrived at the right place. In this review, we explore the good and the bad in the new OnePlus TV, helping you to make a purchase decision.Let us give you a brief about what the OnePlus Y1S Edge\\xa0has to offer:OnePlus\\xa0TV Y1S Edge is available for Rs 16,999 for the 32-inch model and Rs 27,999 for the bigger 43 inches.DesignKeeping in line with OnePlus tradition, the TV Y1S Edge brings a sense of premium-ness to the budget segment here. The bottom bezel has a metallic coating, the panel is sleek and the panel is bezel-less - all of which make for a modern look. For those who want to place the TV on the table, the stands are firmly placed to hold the TV Y1S Edge intact. The subtle OnePlus logo and the light indicator below add to the minimalistic look. Despite the plastic build of the TV (including the stands), it doesn't look cheap.On the back of the panel are Ethernet port, RF port, HDMI ports, USB, AV Input and Digital Audio output ports, all of them nicely tucked away. In this age of wireless connectivity, you'll use the ports only when there's a lack of an alternative. For everything else, there's Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0 support and OnePlus Connect 2.0.DisplayOnePlus TV Y1S Edge has a 43-inch panel with 1920x1080 resolution. The LED-backlit LCD panel renders good picture quality. There are a host of features packed inside to ensure you get a premium experience. There is support for HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG formats, which means your Netflix and YouTube binge-watching sessions are sorted. On the downside, you miss out on Dolby Vision.The default settings in the TV right out of the box will deliver the optimum viewing experience, but you can fine-tune display settings to your liking and you'll find the settings to be quite useful. The end result, you get a bright, sharp and vivid output. The OnePlus TV, at its affordable price range, is ideal for viewing HDR content.The Gamma Engine integration offers features like anti-aliasing, noise reduction and dynamic contrast, which are touted to offer a better experience, but you'll notice little difference. The OnePlus TV's colour palette is as good as you'd get on a budget TV, but the details and contrast levels are good. Overall, the viewing experience on the OnePlus TV Y1S Edge is well worth its buck.AudioOnePlus TV Y1S Edge comes with two speakers facing downwards, which are complemented by Dolby Audio. The speakers deliver an output of 24W, which gets loud enough to fill the room with clear vocals and bass. Low-frequency notes are often muffled, it's not something you cannot fix with an additional speaker or a soundbar. Or simply just crank up the volume, and you should be good to go, but the only disadvantage would be that all other sounds will get loud, too. Investing in an affordable soundbar won't hurt, but depending on the square footage of the room or living room, you can take a call on whether you really need it or not.User interface and featuresOnePlus TV Y1S Edge is powered by the latest OxygenPlay 2.0 based on Android 11, which bags a host of interesting and useful features. If you own a OnePlus smartphone, you're truly in for a treat. OnePlus has wonderfully built its ecosystem and seamless cross-device integration is worthy of applause.For instance, you can use your OnePlus smartphone to control most of your TV and even pair the OnePlus Buds as easily as you would with your phone. There's more, if you happen to own the OnePlus Watch, you can do some wizard tricks from your wrist. Like, if you have the habit of falling asleep in front of the TV, the Watch will inform the TV to shut down.The OnePlus Connect 2.0 app offers a host of connectivity features, including casting, taking screenshots and all this even when there's no Wi-Fi or mobile data to connect.OnePlus TV Y1S Edge can be controlled via the remote, and we did not notice any major lags and it appeared snappy. It's impressive how much a budget TV such as the Y1S Edge can do for its asking price. OnePlus is not tight-fisted about sharing the features it offers in its premium Q-range.Under the hood, the Y1S Edge has a quad-core MediaTek processor, 1GB RAM and 8GB storage, which is shared among the OS and apps. The overall performance is acceptable and the apps would launch reasonably quick.VerdictOnePlus TV Y1S Edge is a well-rounded smart TV, which can be a perfect addition as your secondary TV or even the primary one if you're looking for something on a budget. At Rs 27,999, it's definitely one of the better choices to go for. If you already have a OnePlus smartphone among other accessories by the brand, this new addition will be well worth its price. In fact, the ecosystem factor is what makes this TV more appealing than the competition, which can be fierce given the price range it competes.OnePlus TV Y1S has a premium and sleek design, good panel, and some excellent convenient features. The only issue would be that the OnePlus TV Y1S is treading in dangerous territory. There's some tough competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Redmi TVs in this very price range.\"),\n",

For every 25 HDFC Bank shares owned, each HDFC shareholder will receive 42 HDFC Bank shares.\"This is a merger of equals.

In contrast to the current assignment route, the combined entity will be able to offer mortgage products seamlessly, according to Deepak Parekh, who spoke at a press conference today. Moreover, When costs are reduced, the merged firm enjoys cost savings and is value accretive for both HDFC and HDFC Bank shareholders.It is to be noted that the merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank has been in the news for some time. In reality, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh stated in 2015 that his company would explore merging with HDFC Bank if the circumstances were favourable. However, due to the parent\\'s decision to put the merger on hold, the wait for the merger grew longer.

The speakers deliver an output of 24W, which gets loud enough to fill the room with clear vocals and bass. Low-frequency notes are often muffled, it's not something you cannot fix with an additional speaker or a soundbar. Or simply just crank up the volume, and you should be good to go, but the only disadvantage would be that all other sounds will get loud, too. Investing in an affordable soundbar won't hurt, but depending on the square footage of the room or living room, you can take a call on whether you really need it or not.User interface and featuresOnePlus TV Y1S Edge is powered by the latest OxygenPlay 2.0 based on Android 11, which bags a host of interesting and useful features. If you own a OnePlus smartphone, you're truly in for a treat. OnePlus has wonderfully built its ecosystem and seamless cross-device integration is worthy of applause.For instance, you can use your OnePlus smartphone to control most of your TV and even pair the OnePlus Buds as easily as you would with your phone. There's more, if you happen to own the OnePlus Watch, you can do some wizard tricks from your wrist. Like, if you have the habit of falling asleep in front of the TV, the Watch will inform the TV to shut down.The OnePlus Connect 2.0 app offers a host of connectivity features, including casting, taking screenshots and all this even when there's no Wi-Fi or mobile data to connect.OnePlus TV Y1S Edge can be controlled via the remote, and we did not notice any major lags and it appeared snappy. It's impressive how much a budget TV such as the Y1S Edge can do for its asking price. OnePlus is not tight-fisted about sharing the features it offers in its premium Q-range.Under the hood, the Y1S Edge has a quad-core MediaTek processor, 1GB RAM and 8GB storage, which is shared among the OS and apps. The overall performance is acceptable and the apps would launch reasonably quick.VerdictOnePlus TV Y1S Edge is a well-rounded smart TV, which can be a perfect addition as your secondary TV or even the primary one if you're looking for something on a budget. At Rs 27,999, it's definitely one of the better choices to go for. If you already have a OnePlus smartphone among other accessories by the brand, this new addition will be well worth its price. In fact, the ecosystem factor is what makes this TV more appealing than the competition, which can be fierce given the price range it competes.OnePlus TV Y1S has a premium and sleek design, good panel, and some excellent convenient features. The only issue would be that the OnePlus TV Y1S is treading in dangerous territory. There's some tough competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Redmi TVs in this very price range.\")]"
