But not everyone gets it ', 'The well-known YouTuber Sean Chandler struggled to say it directly. “I really think Turning Red is going to be Pixar’s most polarizing film. Based on most Twitter reactions and it’s [sic] initial RT [Rotten Tomatoes] score, lots of people are loving it. But there’s a handful of us which it really rubbed the wrong way,” he tweeted. “Pixar usually makes films w/ broad appeal. Turning Red is intentionally niche,” he added in another post.What is alienating and niche about a Toronto girl who sometimes turns into a red panda? What makes it “weird,” as this popular movie critic has said? Well, it’s all about how the film’s protagonist, Meilin, or Mei Mei to her family, gets her period.Director Domee Shi and co-writer Julia Cho have come up with an apt metaphor to describe the discombobulating experience of becoming a teenager and the accompanying changes that happen to one’s body. Mei Mei is 13 years old and lives in Toronto in 2002. She is a model only child in a family of Chinese origin. She gets straight A’s in school, plays the flute in the band, has a gang of rather nerdy friends, and when she finishes her classes, she comes home to help her parents run the temple they dedicate to their ancestors. Her mother fits the Asian-American stereotype of the “Tiger Mom:” a righteous, unrelenting woman who holds her daughter up as a kind of blueprint for excellence. All that changes the day Mei Mei wakes up transformed into a red panda. Suddenly she is a wild creature. She smells funny. Her mood swings are unpredictable. She can’t control her emotions. She likes boys. She doesn’t like her mother. And she needs, nay, absolutely MUST go see her favorite boy band, 4*Town. The band’s songs in the film, by the way, were written by singer Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O’Connell.The first Pixar film to be solely directed by a woman – Shi is also responsible for the award-winning short Bao – has a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes, with only light criticism from some corners like Maya Philips of the New York Times, who wondered whether its portrayal of Asian women is representation or stereotype. But there are also male voices who simply don’t get it, who all express themselves in similar terms: “This is not what Pixar usually does. I only see a very small group of people capable of understanding this film,” notes one audience reviewer.The critic Sean O’Connell wrote a widely condemned review for CinemaBlend where he criticized the film for its lack of universal themes. “I recognized the humor in the film, but connected with none of it. By rooting Turning Red very specifically in the Asian community of Toronto, the film legitimately feels like it was made for Domee Shi’s friends and immediate family members. Which is fine… but also, a tad limiting in its scope.” The review was later pulled while O’Connell doubled down on Twitter: “Some Pixar films are made for universal audiences. Turning Red is not. The target audience for this one feels very specific and very narrow. If you are in it, this might work very well for you. I am not in it. This was exhausting.”The backlash was immediate: “Turning Red is a coming of age story that literally anybody can relate to. It’s about a teen growing up, starting to explore their independence & the awkwardness/challenges that come with that phase in their lives. So many of us have lived through that,” tweeted the new site POC Culture. “This is what happens when white males are presented as the default. Audiences have empathized w/ white male protagonists forever but you get one Asian girl in animation & these people question their existence. #TurningRed.” O’Connell, who is also the managing director of CinemaBlend, has since apologized.The controversy in particular centers on the portrayal of non-white characters, but it is striking how some reviewers are unable to understand a film about a girl whose red peony has bloomed, as Meilin’s mother poetically puts it. For something that is so close for much of its audience, rival animation studio Disney has long shied away from the issue of puberty and its complications. The recent film Luca was a departure in some ways, by exploring the mismatch that occurs when two friends grow up at different speeds. A ten-minute Disney short called The Story of Menstruation was produced for the Kimberly-Clark Company in 1946 and aired in schools. But other than that, no one ever thought to allude to the hormonal changes of Mulan, Moana or Merida from Brave.In Pixar’s Turning Red, periods are always at the heart of the film, starting with the title, as one of the producers, Lindsey Collins, explained to Polygon magazine: “It was always in the very earliest versions of the film. It was the first thing we put into production,” she said. “Everybody on the crew was unapologetic in support of having these real conversations about periods and about these moments in girls’ lives.” She admits that both she and the director feared the reaction of Pixar executives, but they discovered their fears were unfounded. “I think they saw it very much in the DNA of the film and the characters,” Collins said. “The hope is with putting it on the screen and having it be something that is cringy, but also funny, and a part of this story, it does normalize it.”The studio, which has undergone a shakeup following the departure of its founder, John Lasseter, over sexual harassment allegations in 2017, once had a serious problem with female characters and certainly with the number of women working on its films. In 2012, screenwriter and animator Brenda Chapman developed the story of Brave, about a Scottish heiress who doesn’t want to be a princess and accidentally turns her mother into a bear. It’s not unreasonable to think that the Turning Red team is paying homage to her with their red panda. However, the studio fired her as director and put Mark Andrews as co-director in the credits. Chapman explained the effect this had on her in an article in The New York Times. “This was a story that I created, which came from a very personal place, as a woman and a mother. To have it taken away and given to someone else, and a man at that, was truly distressing on so many levels,” she wrote.“Animation used to be mostly dudes,” Lasseter himself said in 2015, and it mostly still is. Only 26% of people working in animation in the US are women, according to a study by job search website Zippia. It has taken a film from the largest animation studio to have a female director, female producer and female screenwriter for the first time for a film to talk about periods. For some, women’s visibility can only be interpreted as their own marginalization.'], ['The surprising case of Catalina de Erauso: The first trans portrait in history finds its voice 400 years later', '2022-03-16', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-16/the-case-of-catalina-de-erauso-the-first-trans-portrait-in-history-finds-its-voice-400-years-later.html', 'A  new show in Bilbao, in northern Spain, explores the life and legacy of the 17th-century explorer who started out as a nun and ended up traveling in the Americas under male identities', 'Catalina de Erauso is a difficult historical figure to define. On the one hand, she is a Spanish conqueror who massacred indigenous people, and on the other, she is a transgender icon who defied gender norms at a time when the concept of transgender did not exist in the public consciousness.Much about Erauso, who is also known as “La Monja Alférez” in Spanish, or The Lieutenant Nun, is shrouded in mystery. It’s known that she was born in San Sebastián in Spain’s Basque Country, but there is no exact birthdate: it could have either been 1588 or 1592.Erauso was sent to a convent to be trained as a nun, but escaped and evaded capture by dressing as a boy. From that moment on, she created a number of personas. Sometimes she presented herself as a woman, but nearly always she dressed as a man, going by names such as Pedro de Orive, Francisco de Loyola, Alonso Díaz and Antonio de Erauso.She was reportedly granted an audience with Pope Urban II, and even received a pension from King Felipe IV for her military services in the Americas colonies. Most of what is known about Erauso comes from her autobiography, but many researchers doubt the authenticity of the text, arguing that at the very least it is filled with sections that were added at a later date.But perhaps the main reason why Erauso is so hard to define is due to her exploits in the military. Erauso was responsible for the death of many people. Not only did she kill others in duels and squabbles, she also actively took part in the extermination of the indigenous people of the Americas in the service of the Spanish Crown.Now a new exhibition called Una voz para Erauso. Epílogo para un tiempo trans (or, A voice for Erauso. An epilogue for a trans time) by the art collective Cabello/Carceller, is shining a light on these complexities.Trans philosopher Paul B. Preciado, who commissioned the exhibition, explains: “When you are gay, lesbian or trans, [Erauso] is a character that has special resonance, because she was almost a drag king in the middle of the Renaissance.”The exhibit, which will be on display until September 25 at the Azkuna Zentroa cultural center in the Basque city of Bilbao, centers on a video in which three contemporary characters question Erauso about race, gender, class and religion. The questions are addressed to a portrait of Erauso that was made by Spanish painter Juan van der Hamen around 1625. The portrait, as well as a copy made in 1900, are also part of the exhibition.The artists behind the collective, Helena Cabello and Ana Carceller, say that the painting may be the first portrait of a transgender person. “It was thought that the oldest was Chevalier d’Éon [by Jean-Laurent Mosnier in 1791] but, although we cannot unequivocally confirm that this is it [the oldest portrait of a transgender person], we haven’t found an earlier one,” say Cabello and Carceller, who point out that Van der Hamen chose not to emphasize Erauso’s feminine side, but rather “the soldier she wanted to be, with her scars and her warrior-like look.”What’s more, the exhibition does not try to explain the historical figure from the perspective of today. “Erauso belongs to the 16th century, when notions of transsexuality or transgender didn’t exist,” says Preciado. “Cross-dressing did exist, and it was considered against nature and a heretic crime. This makes us think about how the concept of sexuality and gender have changed, from being an ecclesiastic category to a medical-legal status, and now we are fighting so that it simply becomes a way of life.” He adds: “Everyone can imagine how they would have been characterized in Erauso’s times: I, for example, would have been cooked by the Inquisition.”Cabello/Carceller agree that it doesn’t make sense to project 21st-century concepts on a historical figure from the 16th century. In the exhibition, the video turns into a musical when it is Erauso’s turn to respond to the questions, and as Cabello/Carceller explain, these responses are fitting with Erauso’s context.“Erauso was openly pro-monarchy, supported the empire and was proud of having killed, but was also a survivor,” they say. “So the responses [in the video] are along the lines of ‘yes, I’ve killed, so what? I would like to have seen you in my epoch.”English version by Melissa Kitson.'], ['How Kanye West uses Instagram to settle scores', '2022-03-14', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-14/how-kanye-west-uses-instagram-to-settle-scores.html', 'The singer has turned the social network into an arena where he can attack his enemies, even sharing private messages from his ex-wife Kim Kardashian', 'On July 24, 2021, Britney Spears published an emotional message on her Instagram account. “Coming along, folks ... coming along 🖕🏻!!!!! New with real representation today ... I feel GRATITUDE and BLESSED !!!! Thank you to my fans who are supporting me ... You have no idea what it means to me be supported by such awesome fans !!!!” The text was accompanied by a video of the singer riding a horse and doing cartwheels on a lawn. Spears was celebrating the latest step toward ending her father’s conservatorship, which saw him control her finances and personal communications. That day, she used the hashtag #FreeBritney for the first time, after her fans had turned it into a phenomenon on social media – one that gained such traction, that her emancipation became a reality in November of last year.Spears’ continued and spontaneous use of Instagram during that legal process was similar to a kind of personal and intimate daily diary – albeit one that her nearly 40 million followers could read too. Among her posts, of which there was more than one a day, there were images with inspirational phrases, the covers of self-help books, snaps of food, selfies, videos of her dancing, memes, and images of her fiance, model Sam Asghari. Spears’ Instagram account became her direct link with the world, a self-portrait that exuded innocence, sensitivity, optimism and naturalness.Kanye West’s account, meanwhile, is the polar opposite. For someone who has never seen it before, they could be deceived: At the time of writing, there were just three publications: two images with the lyrics of songs called Divorce and Dead, and a photo (since deleted) of West accompanied by a text that explains that his new album, Donda 2, is not eligible for the music charts given that it is only available on an exclusive platform called Stem Player.His 11th album, which is a follow-up to Donda and has come out just a few months after its predecessor, contains unfinished versions of songs and is missing tracks that had been previously announced, and as if that weren’t enough, you have to pay $200 to acquire Stem Player in the first place. That lack of accessibility, clarity and permanence are also there to see on West’s Instagram account, where the singer of Runaway has, for months now, been publishing confusing and controversial messages, only to later delete them.If the daily posts from Britney Spears are full of light, flowers, smiles and messages of overcoming problems, those of Kanye West are filled with torn-out, wrinkled and scorched pages, filled with scrawls and scratches. He has long been a controversial public figure, having had disagreements with other celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Wiz Khalifa and Amber Rose. He also claimed that Bill Cosby was innocent of sexual assault allegations, and infamously took to wearing one of Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” baseball caps. But his use of Instagram (he was previously more active on Twitter) is now reaching levels of hostility and confusion that have never been seen before, either in his own personal history or in digital culture in general.The publication and subsequent deletion of messages began to increase at the end of last year, and has shot up yet further through February, influenced by the divorce from his now ex-wife Kim Kardashian and her new relationship with Saturday Night Live comedian Pete Davidson. The majority of the posts were aimed at the new couple, and the fact that three of the most-famous faces in the United States have been airing their dirty laundry in public has dominated the tabloids, but also the culture and music press, with headlines such as “Everything Kanye West has said on Instagram this week.”In fact, it is West who is airing all of the dirty laundry, without his ex-wife nor her partner able to do a thing about it. One of the most-commented incidents took place over the weekend of the Super Bowl, February 13 and 14. The rapper and producer shared such shocking messages that he decided to publish a photo of himself holding a yellow notepad with the date and a message that read: “My account is not hacked,” just in case anyone could not believe it was really him.One of West’s posts included a message that Davidson had sent him saying that “as a man I’d never get in the way of your children,” and that he hoped to meet them some day. Next to the screenshot of the message West had written (the caps are his): “NO YOU WILL NEVER MEET MY CHILDREN.” He also shared a picture of a truck full of roses, supposedly a gift from West to his ex-wife for Valentine’s Day, and called on his followers to assault Davidson, whom he calls “Skete,” writing: “IF ANYONE LOVES ME AND MY FAMILY IF YOU SEE SKETE IN REAL LIFE SCREAM AT THE LOOSER [SIC] AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS AND SAY KIMYE FOREVER,” “Kimye” being a reference to his relationship with Kardashian (West legally changed his name to Ye last October). He also offered to double the Saturday Night Live salary of Davidson’s colleague on the show, Michael Che, “JUST SO YOU DON’T HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT PAWN EVER AGAIN.”Valentine’s Day was complicated this year for Kim Kardashian, who sent a message to her ex-husband calling on him to stop inciting his followers to assault Davidson. West responded by sharing a screenshot of the message and writing on Instagram: “UPON MY WIFE’S REQUEST PLEASE NOBODY DO ANYTHING PHYSICAL TO SKETE. I’M GOING TO HANDLE THE SITUATION MYSELF.” Then he shared another screenshot of the conversation with the mother of his four children, who asked him why he couldn’t keep their conversations private. “CAUSE I GOT A TEXT FROM MY FAVORITE PERSON IN THE WORLD,” he wrote. “I’M YOUR NUMBER ONE FAN. WHY WOULDN’T I TELL EVERYONE!!!” Then, shortly after, he deleted everything.West has spoken in the past about his bipolar disorder, and admitted that there are times when he doesn’t take his medication because it affects his creativity. His tantrums on Instagram don’t appear to be a good sign with regard to his current state, but it is true that they are in line with something that has always interested the musician: controlling his own public narrative.The question is, what is the narrative that West wants to transmit? Depending on the day, he has stated that God wants to get him back together with Kardashian, he has attacked Davidson, and he has shared pictures of his family together with affectionate words.On another occasion, he shared a mockup of the poster for Captain America: Civil War, apparently created by him, and in which he superimposed pictures of himself along with hip-hop starts Drake, Travis Scott and Future, as well as his then-girlfriend Julia Fox; and on the opposing side, Pete Davidson, with Kim Kardashian, Billie Eilish, Kid Cudi and Taylor Swift.Kanye West shares edited ‘Captain America: Civil War’ poster on Instagram featuring:• Drake• Julia Fox • Travis Scott• Future• Pete Davidson• Kim Kardashian• Kid Cudi• Billie Eilish• Taylor Swift pic.twitter.com/1KERuYiYfAWhat’s genuinely concerning, however, is West’s aggressive tone and abusive behavior toward Kim Kardashian, whom he accuses of coming between him and their four children. After she criticized his behavior, on February 14 he shared a photo of himself with this message: “I know sharing screenshots was jarring and came off as harassing Kim. I take accountability. I’m still learning in real time. I don’t have all the answers. To be a good leader is to be a good listener.”However, two hours later he shared a photo of a roadside billboard that had the following message written on it: “Stop telling fathers they should have fought harder to see their children & start asking mothers why he had to fight at all.” One post included an image from the movie Baby Boy (2001), in which actor Ving Rhames has Tyrese Gibson in a headlock. West tagged Gibson’s face with Kim Kardashian’s Instagram handle.English version by S.

She’s in character as Deirdre Beaubeirdra, and is far from the slender image she usually sports both on screen and off it. In the text accompanying the image, she explains that she told the movie crew: “I want there to be no concealing of anything.” She conveys a message that people should accept their bodies just as they are, and that doing so herself has made her feel “more free creatively and physically” than ever before.The 63-year-old actress went even further on the social network, relating her own experience and claiming that she has been “sucking in my stomach since I was 11, when you start being conscious of boys and bodies, and the jeans are super tight.” She continues: “I very specifically decided to relinquish and release every muscle I had that I used to clench to hide the reality.”The star of the Halloween franchise also made reference to the industry that moves billions of dollars and is dedicated to “hiding things.” “Concealers. Body-shapers. Fillers. Procedures. Clothing. Hair accessories. Hair products. Everything to conceal the reality of who we are,” she wrote to her nearly four million followers on the image-sharing platform.A post shared by Jamie Lee Curtis (@curtisleejamie)In the 1980s and 1990s, Curtis’s slim figure was seen in various states of undress in movies such as Perfect (1985) and True Lies (1994), in the latter film actually stripping for co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger.This is not the first time that Curtis, the daughter of actors Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, has made statements about the cult of physical appearance. In October 2021, during an interview with Fast Company, she said that “the current trend of fillers and procedures, and this obsession with filtering, and the things that we do to adjust our appearance on Zoom are wiping out generations of beauty.” She explained that she had tried plastic surgery but explained that it “didn’t work.”English version by S.

Here’s how they did it', 'Not much gets in the way of Lady Gaga. The actor and singer, whose curriculum also includes other job titles as diverse as composer, activist, producer and occasional model, surprised her fans by adding the gift of ubiquity to her considerable list of talents. The star of House of Gucci was seen on the red carpet at the Bafta Awards in London, which were held at 8pm last Sunday, and then at the Critics’ Choice Awards in Los Angeles, at midnight on the same day. It doesn’t take the world’s greatest mathematician to see that the numbers don’t add up. Not even the fastest private jets can cover the 5,590 miles that separate the two cities in just four hours.The explanation is considerably simpler: the organizers of the Critics’ Choice Awards held two ceremonies that were broadcast simultaneously, one at the Savoy Hotel in London and the other at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles, to ensure the presence of as many star names as possible. It was an emergency measure due to the event being postponed from its original date of January 9 as a result of the omicron coronavirus wave.Despite being nominated for Best Actress at both awards ceremonies, Lady Gaga left empty-handed, but she made plenty of headlines anyway for the striking looks she selected for both events. But she wasn’t the only star to perform the double act: various actors followed suit, among them Ariana DeBose, Alana Haim, Emilia Jones, Rachel Zegler and Troy Kotsur.On the red carpet at the Baftas, Gaga embodied the glamor of classic Tinseltown in a green gown with an elaborate train, a feathered purse (one of the trends of the season) and her hair styled in Hollywood curls in the signature style of Veronica Lake. Shortly afterwards, the star of Ridley Scott’s movie caught the eye with a far more daring outfit at the Critics’ Choice Awards.For that occasion, Gaga chose a gold and black Gucci number with a spectacular neckline, topped off with jewelry from Tiffany & Co. This time, her hair was pinned back and her thick yellow make-up highlighted her eyes, giving her two completely contrasting looks and demonstrating the skill of her stylists, hair and make-up artists to pull off the change in record time. Although she hasn’t been nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Patrizia Reggiani in House of Gucci, Gaga will be at the ceremony in Hollywood on March 27 as a presenter, so her fans and style watchers have not seen the last of her on the red carpet this awards season.Gaga was not alone in making an appearance at both the Baftas and the Critics’ Choice Awards, a night that will have implications in the eagerly anticipated Oscars race. Ariana DeBose, the overwhelming favorite to land the Best Supporting Actress statuette for West Side Story, underlined that status with wins in the same category at both ceremonies last Sunday. At the Critics’ Choice Awards, she collected her honor in a Carolina Herrera gown somewhere between yellow and orange. At the Baftas, DeBose went with a similar color, this time opting for a split-leg Oscar de la Renta dress.Alana Haim, who like Gaga left both events without an award despite Best Actress nominations for Licorice Pizza, wore two Louis Vuitton numbers, green at the Baftas and black at the Critics’ Choice Awards. Emilia Jones, who received a Best Actress nomination at the Baftas and a Best Young Actor/Actress nomination at the Critics’ Choice Awards for her role in CODA, sparkled in a golden Atelier Versace and a more formal black-and-white Vuitton. The biggest winner of the night on both sides of the Atlantic was The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s western landing Best Picture and Best Director at both ceremonies.The award for the most chameleonic attendee may have been won by Rachel Zegler, who although not nominated for an individual award for her portrayal of Maria in West Side Story, went one better than her peers by wearing three different outfits in just a few hours. At the Baftas she wore a deep blue, off-the-shoulder Vivienne Westwood and then switched to a feathered top and sequin skirt by David Koma for the after party. Later she was at the Critics’ Choice Awards in a Dior couture, courtesy of the deft touch of her stylist, Sarah Slutsky, the architect of the swiftest changes of look on the night.English version by Rob Train.'], ['How Michael J. Fox learned to survive in Hollywood with a neurodegenerative disorder', '2022-03-13', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-13/how-michael-j-fox-learned-to-survive-in-hollywood-with-a-neurodegenerative-disorder.html?autoplay=1', 'In his memoir ‘No Time Like the Future,’ the actor recalls the last years of his career, how he kept working and incorporating the disease into his characters, and why he decided to retire in 2020', 'In 1991, Michael J. Fox received a piece of news that would change his life. At the peak of his career, months after the third installment of Back to the Future had made $244 million (€220 million) at the box office, a neurologist that Fox had gone to see after noticing muscle pain and shaking in one finger, gave him his diagnosis: Parkinson’s disease. In No Time Like the Future: An Optimist Considers Mortality, recently released in Spanish, Fox recalls the doctor telling him that he might be able to work 10 more years. He was 29 at the time.The following months weren’t easy for him or his wife, actress Tracy Pollan. Terrified and trying to understand what the future would bring, Fox began drinking. The situation grew unsustainable. Encouraged by his wife, he sought psychological help to manage his demons. His son Sam, born in 1989, recalls that one of his earliest memories is going to the fridge to get a beer for his father. Therapy helped the actor stop drinking and strengthen his relationship with his family. In 1994, Tracy got pregnant with twins, Aquinnah and Schuyler, and in 2001 they welcomed another child, Esmé. “People felt strangely comfortable asking if we were concerned about bearing more children while dealing with the open-ended escalation of a major neurological disorder, and the fear that the babies could inherit the disease,” Fox writes. “The question could be construed as inappropriate, but the answer was: We weren’t concerned, nor should they be.” It remained to be seen how soon he would have to bid goodbye to the cameras.Rather than make his illness public, Fox decided to continue working as long as his body would allow. The moment he feared arrived in the spring of 1998, during the filming of the series Spin City. “My character on Spin City didn’t have PD; so by the end of our second season, it was difficult for him to believably pass as physically uncompromised. Increasingly worried that my random movements would alienate the audience and alienate them if I did (Would they still think I’m funny if they knew I had PD?), I chose to publicly disclose my condition,” Fox remembers.Fox made his condition public in November 1998. Two years later, after turning 40, he retired from show business because, according to him, his face had lost its past expressiveness. At that time he created the Michael J. Fox Foundation, an NGO that funds the search for a cure to Parkinson’s disease. In his memoir, Fox said he had always liked being an actor that editors would cut to at any time for an appropriate reaction, his face always alive in a scene. Whether speaking or not, he liked his characters to always be animated and engaged. But gradually, with the effects of Parkinson’s, “my face began retreating to a passive, almost frozen disposition.”That hiatus didn’t end up lasting as long as Fox had expected. In 2004, after getting a call from Bill Lawrence, co-creator of Spin City, he agreed to appear in two episodes of the comedy Scrubs. The role of doctor Kevin Casey, an eccentric neurosurgeon with obsessive-compulsive disorder, allowed him to think about his professional future from a new perspective.“I discovered that I could focus less on the externals and stop trying to hide my symptoms. This was in stark relief from my days on Spin City, when I’d keep a live audience waiting while I paced my dressing room, pounding my arm with my fist in a vain attempt to quell the tremors. On Scrubs, instead of trying to kill it, Invited my Parkinson’s with me to the set. I felt free to concentrate on the task that any actor, able-bodied or not, is charged with accomplishing: uncovering the internal life of another human being. Putting the emphasis on my character’s vulnerabilities and not my own, Parkinson’s could in fact disappear.”Though he no longer held the star status of the 1980s and 90s, aside from his role as voice of the protagonist in Stuart Little, the small screen gave Fox an escape route. His minor characters on Boston Legal (2004-2008) and Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000), where he dared to turn his illness into humor, gave him a sense of salvation. His role on Rescue Me won him an Emmy in 2009 for Best Guest Actor.Fox’s favorite role from that period was the lawyer Louis Canning on The Good Wife (2009-2016), who he played for 26 episodes over four seasons. “The Good Wife writers created a character who shamelessly exploits his own misfortune, converting it into an asset to win sympathy and jury votes. … Disabled and differently abled characters are always seen in a sympathetic light, soft piano music rising to crescendo as they achieve their relatively modest goals. This guy was different. He was debilitated, but no piano. He was an asshole.”“Mine is not a mental disorder or an emotional one, although these issues can develop. It is neurological, and manifests in a corruption of movement,” Fox explains in No Time Like the Future. “Some people will focus on the slight palsy, the tremoring of fingers and limbs. That’s certainly a part of it. But at least in my experience these symptoms have become more manageable over time. Much more difficult to acknowledge and accept is the diminishment of movement.”Fox’s case is special. His significant fortune allows him to face the illness and its consequences. But the Spanish Parkinson’s Federation notes that, beyond Hollywood, “it’s important for companies to promote positive measures and work accommodations to help people with Parkinson’s who want to remain active as long as possible. And in cases when they cannot keep their jobs, they should have social protections that adjust to their needs and allow for access to disability support.”Fox’s health declined considerably at the end of 2017. Alarmed by a sudden tendency to collapse onto the ground, in January 2018 he had an MRI. An old spinal cord tumor, which had been under control for years, had started to grow.“Given the size and location of the tumor at the cervicothoracic junction, it is risky. I mean, who wants to be the guy who paralyzes Michael J. Fox?” The words from doctor Nicholas Theodore, director of the Neurological and Spine Center at Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, didn’t bother him in the least. On the contrary: “I tend to trust folks who make me laugh when things get grim.”Despite the fact that in April 2018 the tumor was successfully removed, Fox spent the following months in intense rehabilitation sessions to recover his mobility and control of his movements.On August 13 of that same year, a fall set back Fox’s recovery. Spike Lee had offered him a brief cameo in See You Yesterday, a movie about time travel–with a wink to Back to the Future. That morning, Fox had been elated to return to a film set, but he had to cancel his appearance after he fell to the floor of his New York apartment. “My family has put up with so much crap. Four months since I had major back surgery, and I gambled the health and the security of my family by being a fool,” he wrote about the unexpected accident that shattered his humerus.After another round in the operating room, which left him with 19 screws in his arm, Fox’s characteristic optimism vanished. He fell into an existential crisis tinged with depression. “Counterintuitively, Parkinson’s and the tumor on my spine were easier to accept than my fracture. The arm crisis was there in an instant, an explosion. A cataclysm. I am unprepared for the fallout. My mood darkens,” he recounts in the book.In 2019, Fox’s luck changed. Spike Lee offered him the possibility of filming that leftover scene from See You Yesterday. And in the fourth season of The Good Fight, the sequel to The Good Wife, he once again took on the role of Louis Canning. The sensation of returning to familiar territory was a relief. But he soon realized that production had a smaller budget and a tighter schedule. At the same time, he started to have trouble pronouncing certain words in the script.“Now, my work as an actor does not define me. The nascent diminishment in my ability to download words and repeat them verbatim is just the latest ripple in the pond. There are reasons for my lapses in memorization–be they age, cognitive issues with the disease, distraction from the constant sensations of Parkinson’s, or lack of sensation because of the spine–but I read it as a simple message. Everything has its moment, and my time of working 12-hour days and memorizing seven pages of lines has ended. At least for now.”Many other public figures, including the actress Helen Mirren, the boxer Muhammad Ali, the musician Ozzy Osbourne and the painter Salvador Dalí have faced struggles with Parkinson’s. Michael J. Fox announced his definitive retirement in November 2020, at age 59, a full 20 years later than his neurologist had predicted in 1991. And that may be the biggest success of his career.'], ['Life after porn: Simon Rex, the actor reliving his past to redeem it', '2022-03-20', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-20/life-after-porn-simon-rex-the-actor-reliving-his-past-to-redeem-it.html', 'He was a forgotten teen idol and an industry pariah, but ‘Red Rocket’ has brought him awards and the best reviews of his life. Fact and fiction blend in a film that also considers how pornography has leapt from screens to life', 'Actor Simon Rex, 47, may be the last person in the history of Hollywood who believed he could shoot four porn movies, find fame and live in a world where this past wouldn’t come out.It started in 1993, when he was 19 years old and cleaning tables. Desperate to stay afloat, he answered an ad in a Los Angeles newspaper seeking models to pose nude. That resulted in four tapes with not exactly cryptic titles (Young, Hard and Alone, for example, or Hot Sessions I, II and III) which, when Rex became a celebrity in the United States, were re-released a few years later and saw the light of day thanks to the internet.Rex thus became the epitome of the star born at the dawn of a new era, who has a hidden past that catches him by surprise: a new era in which nothing that has ever been recorded, written or said can be forgotten. That Rex is talking again about the subject he avoided for years, as if it were an exorcism, is because he plays a porn actor in Red Rocket, the new film by Sean Baker, who in Tangerine (2015) or The Florida Project (2017) portrayed the dreams and hopes of the lumpen who survive behind the neon lights of Las Vegas or Disneyland. Red Rocket, which opens in Spain in May, has brought Rex - who at the height of his fame was a pretty face, in his decline a joke and during the last few years a pariah - some of the best reviews of the year, the award for best actor at the Independent Spirit Awards and, incidentally, a reconciliation with the murkiest part of his past.With the exception of porn, Simon Rex’s biography resembles that of many other photogenic young people in the right place at the right time. Accompanying his childhood sweetheart to a model casting, an agency director noticed him. The [ensuing] dialogue is so commonplace as to be cliché: “Who is he?”. “He’s not a model, he’s just here with me.” The next scene is another cliché: Simon Rex flies to Milan.In 1995 he posed in campaigns for brands like Tommy Hilfiger and coincided in fashion shows and parties with Mark Ronson, then also a model. That same year, the MTV network asked Markus Schenkenberg, one of the most famous models of the 1990s, to audition as a host, but as he was unable to attend, his agency sent Rex instead.For two years, Rex became a popular figure who introduced music videos (when they were still being broadcast on TV) and interviewed artists, often [while] shirtless, in order to show off a superior physique obtained a little bit from the gym, a little bit from genes.Rex was used to the eccentric life: born in San Francisco to hippie parents (his mother was an environmental activist; his father a photographer), you would think he was just carried on a gentle breeze of opportunity from the restaurant where he bussed tables to MTV parties. Having demonstrated his brilliance as a host on the music network that defined the aesthetic and youthful feel of the 1990s, acting soon came knocking at his door. As revealed in an interview with New York Magazine, Gus Van Sant was one watcher who fell in love with Rex’s mix of Greek-god body and boyish character and called him for an audition for a supporting role in Good Will Hunting (1997). It was a disaster, but sensing some potential in the boy, Van Sant recommended he go to acting classes before looking any further.That was the period of time when those early videos came to the light. The production company that owned the original films found a vein in having an unexpected star in its stable and at a time when file sharing, especially pornographic content, after the leak of the Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee sex tape, was on the rise. Individual scenes in which Simon Rex could be seen masturbating while elevator music played in the background became very popular on the internet.The consequences? It could have been worse. As Rex stated in an interview on Allegedly audio, Disney canceled a project he was working on with the young star. But television gave him the opportunity to play a supporting role in successful series such as Jack & Jill (a spoof of Friends) or Felicity. Although those tapes were aimed at a gay audience, there was no contact between Rex and other men. In the conversation with Allegedly, the actor confesses that, after the tapes came to light, MTV asked him: “Do you have sex with other people in them [the tapes]?” If Rex had been shown having sex with other men, his career probably would have ended there.The mystique of porn has seduced Hollywood since its beginnings, ever since it was whispered that someone had seen Joan Crawford or Marilyn Monroe in supposedly explicit pirate films (then called stag films) before they became famous. Greta Garbo’s route went in reverse: the last film she appeared in was a gay porn tape called Adam & Yves, from 1974, but she didn’t know it (she was filmed walking down the street in a flashback scene that obviously has nothing pornographic about it). Shortly after that Rocky (1976), the film that made Sylvester Stallone a star, was released, and it sparked interest in a low-budget, pornographic product he had shot six years earlier, Party at Kitty and Stud’s. In 2022, Pam & Tommy, the series distributed internationally by Disney about the TV Star and the rocker’s aforementioned [sex] tape, is triumphing. And when porn has reached Disney, it’s a sign that porn has already permeated everywhere.“This series reflects the massive fascination with thieved images of sexual content generated in privacy, as opposed to the apathy that can be aroused by sexual images created expressly to be consumed,” say Elisa McCausland and Diego Salgado. Both are film critics, she specializing in popular culture, he one of the authors of the treatise Porno: Come and See. “Viewing people famous for a consensual and accepted codification of their image on a public level involved in a situation of strict intimacy immediately links them to ours”.And what about the enormous success that Simon Rex’s scenes, blurry in quality and monotonous in content, continue to have, when there are millions of better-quality scenes and more explicit stunts? “We attach a greater degree of reality to a poor image compared to the simulacrum we associate with the too-perfect image. When we consume industrially filmed videos, to climax to orgasm what we look for almost desperately are the moments of truth; a shudder, a smile, a tear.”This is borne out by a key moment from those Rex videos, which Michael Ferguson captures in the book Idol Worship: A Shameless Celebration of Male Beauty in the Movies and is so prophetic that today it seems like part of a script: after Rex finishes one of his scenes, and apparently unaware that the camera is still rolling, he says to someone on the crew, “I hate to do this, but the bills have to be paid; I can shake it off for money. I don’t care. As long as no one touches me, it doesn’t matter. I hope this doesn’t come back to haunt me when I’m famous!”.Simon Rex’s role in Red Rocket is one of the most unexpected triumphant comebacks in Hollywood in recent years. Nobody remembered him and, if they did, it was not with a good feeling: in the 21st century Rex became a rapper, the star of infamous commercials that he only accepted for money and a tabloid character more famous for hanging out with Paris Hilton than for his movies. He had success with a couple of installments of the Scary Movie saga, but when Part Five was released, he didn’t even appear on the poster. When he went up to collect the award for best actor at the Independent Spirit Awards gala, which honors the best of independent cinema, the first thing he exclaimed was: “What the fuck?” He then dedicated these words to director Sean Baker: “You gave me a chance when I wasn’t even getting called back for insurance commercials.” “My career was in the toilet,” he continued. “I had gone to live in Joshua Tree [a desert area in Southern California] and I thought it was all over until Sean called me and said, ‘You’re not going to make any money on this and neither am I, but let’s make a little movie.”Movies about porn stars have provided an opportunity to actors that the industry had never taken too seriously. Simon Rex’s case is reminiscent of Mark Wahlberg’s in Boogie Nights (1997), with which Paul Thomas Anderson made a name for himself and gave the actor the best reviews of his career. After a series of stumbles and failures, Val Kilmer also got good reviews for giving life to the porn star John Holmes (famous for having a penis so big that it ended up ruining his life) in Wonderland (2003). All of them were complicated roles, sometimes with demands that would cause other actors to recoil (in both Boogie Nights and Red Rocket one sees the member the protagonist in detail, in each case a prosthesis) but which were ideal for someone who, like Rex, Wahlberg or Kilmer, had nothing to lose. The verdict is obvious: a desperate interpretation of a desperate role gives us, as viewers, an immediate sense of truth.Comparing Red Rocket and Boogie Nights also serves as an index of how porn has invaded every aspect of culture and our intimacy. In one of the best sequences in Boogie Nights, in the first fuck between Mark Wahlberg’s character and the one played by Julianne Moore, there is so much chemistry between them that they forget they are on a set and she effectively invites him to make love to her and forget the hijinks. In Red Rocket the opposite happens: Simon Rex’s character only knows how to fuck like his alter ego would, turning intimacy into a choreographed and dialogued intercourse like on a film set. Alberto Mira, a film scholar and professor at Oxford Brookes University (who included Red Rocket in his list of best films seen in 2021), finds it curious that the film stars precisely an actor who lived and suffered the transformation from old porn to modern porn. “In the film, he is already a relic of the past. Porn stories have become outdated because the dynamics they proposed (the plot, the staging, the typologies) have become outdated. But porn culture in general continues and is everywhere. In an abstract way, everything, especially social networks, works like pornography. So the question we should ask ourselves should be: is porn still porn when it’s already everywhere?”“There are films about the current paradigm of the porn industry as celebrated as Pleasure (2021), by Swedish director Ninja Thyberg,” that are, as McCausland and Salgado point out, “not exactly romantic in their depiction of the porn environment, especially the actresses. Nor is Red Rocket: the main character’s comments on the industry speak of a world in crisis. If Boogie Nights could afford to be romantic, it is because, like it or not, pornographic cinema was synonymous in the 1970s with emancipation and freedom. Today, the industry can no longer clothe itself in those values.” Red Rocket, in fact, does not speak of values. Its protagonist is as amoral as he is charming, and the viewer feels uncomfortable finding so much brilliance in him. As it happens, during the film, Donald Trump is running for office.

She has confessed on a number of occasions that she needed to definitively stop so that she could dedicate some time to herself, and that coming out of the spotlight had brought her “peace.”In an interview with the singer Michelle Visage in her new BBC podcast Rule Breakers, the star of There’s Something About Mary spoke at length about how much her life has changed since she walked away from the movie industry after making Annie in 2014. “I am absolutely a victim to all of the societal objectification and exploitations that women are subjected to,” she said. “I have bought into all of them myself at certain times.”The 49-year-old actress said it was really hard to stay away from established beauty canons. She would sit in front of the mirror, fixating on perceived problems. “You just start to pick yourself apart, you know,” she said. “And you’re like, ‘Why I am sitting here like being so mean to myself?’ My body’s strong, my body’s capable. Why am I going to talk down to it? Why am I going to be mean to it when it’s like carried me this far?”But now, she says, she no longer does that. “I don’t care. Literally, the last thing I think about on a daily basis, like maybe not at all during the day, is what I look like,” said the Golden Globe nominee, who also revealed that she no longer bothers with a daily beauty routine despite having “a billion products” on her shelves.“I literally do nothing,” she told Visage. “Twice a month if I’m lucky, I’ll be like, ‘Oh, I better put this on. One time works, right?’ Like is that all I have to do? I’m just not in that place right now like where I put any energy.”Instead, she is focusing on “staying strong” ahead of her 50th birthday, coming up in August.Ever since her marriage to the musician Benjamin Madden in 2015, Diaz has decided to focus on her family. The actress has a two-year-old child, Raddix Madden, whom she is keen to keep out of the spotlight, as she told the host Kevin Hart in an interview on the talk show Hart to Heart in 2020, just a few months after the baby’s birth.'], ['A decade on, Disney’s ‘John Carter’ is still remembered for one of the worst marketing campaigns in movie history', '2022-03-12', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-12/a-decade-on-disneys-john-carter-is-still-remembered-for-one-of-the-worst-marketing-campaigns-in-movie-history.html', 'Based on a classic novel by Edgar R. Burroughs, helmed by Pixar’s golden boy and with a script by a Pulitzer-winning writer, the film seemed destined for success. Instead it tanked', 'If you were to ask someone where they were on March 11, 2012, it is unlikely the answer would be “at the movies watching John Carter.” If they said that they were, they would have been one of precious few viewers giving Disney something to smile about. The hit the studio took on the movie has been estimated at $200 million by CNN, turning what was going to be the box-office smash of the year into one of Disney’s biggest flops.The funny thing is, the reasons for its failure were not the standard ones. It was not a production beset by financial problems and filming setbacks like Waterworld in 1995; neither was there a clash of egos as between Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer on the 1996 The Island of Dr. Moreau, nor the piles of whiskey and cocaine that sunk Robert Altman’s Popeye in 1980. Quite the opposite in fact: the problem with John Carter was the excessive leeway given to its director and the laxity of inexperienced executives. But then, who was going to rein in director Andrew Stanton, one of Disney’s prized assets after the smash hits WALL-E and Finding Nemo? Nobody wanted to ruffle the feathers of Pixar’s golden egg-laying goose.The issues started with the concept. What Disney saw as a blockbuster destined to launch a new galactic saga – two sequels were already planned – was for Stanton the culmination of a lifelong dream. He approached the project as though it was Batman without taking into account that the vast majority of moviegoers had never heard of John Carter. “He could see no idea in which someone didn’t know who John Carter of Mars was. But it’s not Frankenstein; it’s not Sherlock Holmes. Nobody cares. People don’t say, ‘I know what I’ll be for Halloween! I’ll be John Carter!’” one of the movie’s marketing executives told Vulture magazine.The character of John Carter was created by Edgar Rice Burroughs as a US Confederate Army captain who dies and is reborn on Mars (styled by Burroughs as Barsoom) where two warring cities are vying for control of the planet and where Carter falls in love with a Martian princess. The movie is based on Burroughs’ novel A Princess of Mars, published in 1912, and the John Carter series has influenced almost every science fiction franchise since then. Star Wars would be inconceivable without John Carter – a desert planet, a gunslinger and a princess he falls for: sounds familiar? Swap a desert planet for a leafy one and you have Avatar. Neither George Lucas nor James Cameron have ever denied that Burroughs’ work was essential to their movies. Which begs the question: how could the novel that inspired two of the biggest box-office successes of all time fail to inspire itself?The adventures of John Carter had been bouncing around the offices of Hollywood executives since the 1930s. At that time, Looney Tunes director Bob Clampett pitched the idea of an animated movie to Burroughs, but it never came together. Neither did a subsequent idea from the hand of animation maestro Ray Harryhausen. It wasn’t until the 1990s when it became closer to becoming reality with John McTiernan, who directed Die Hard, Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts lined up, but the technical difficulty of the project saw McTiernan shelve it in favor of Last Action Hero, which didn’t exactly set the box office alight, either. Roberts also forgot about the idea, but Cruise retained his interest.After McTiernan, the project was picked up and dropped first by Robert Rodríguez and then by Jon Favreau, who instead opted for Iron Man. Eventually, it reached Andrew Stanton. “That’s something I have spent my whole life wishing somebody would make, and when I was in the industry from maybe the ‘90s on, if I ever heard even the slightest rumor it might get made, I would get all excited like a fanboy and go, ‘I’ll be the first in line to go and see it,’” Stanton told The Wrap. “I never had the hubris to think that’s something I would want to do or could do.”With Stanton on board to direct, attention turned to the leads, a part of the process that can often be the hardest but for Stanton was simple: he was convinced that the Canadian model and actor Taylor Kitsch, who had starred as football player Tim Riggins in Friday Night Lights and played Gambit on X-Men Origins: Wolverine, was the physical incarnation of John Carter. But the shadow of Tom Cruise still hung over the project. It is easy to imagine Disney rubbing their hands together at the prospect of a franchise with Cruise as its lead, but Stanton had complete control. “I had Taylor already in mind by the time Tom made his interest known. Tom had a long history with the material, so it wasn’t too surprising to discover he still had interest in it,” Stanton told The Wrap. “We agreed to talk further if I were to pass on Taylor, but I obviously didn’t. It was as simple and non-controversial as that.”Lynn Collins, who had worked with Kitsch on X-Men, was chosen to play the princess, Dejah Thoris. Neither lead was a huge star in their own right but they were backed by a stellar cast including Willem Dafoe, Samantha Morton and Bryan Cranston. And Pulitzer Prize-winner Michael Chabon, a fan of Burroughs’ novels just like Stanton, was brought in to write the script.With the cast settled and production underway the problems started to emerge, starting with the movie’s title. The logical choice would have been A Princess of Mars, but Stanton believed that with that title “not a single boy” would go to the movie theater. He favored John Carter of Mars – the last book in Burroughs’ series – but Disney’s marketing executive, MT Carney, who was new to the industry and had no previous experience with cinema, decided there had been too many recent movies with Mars in the title that had flopped (Mission to Mars and Red Planet in 2000 and Mars Needs Moms in 2011). As such, Carney decided the movie would be called simply John Carter. “That was first moment, I was like, ‘Oh, fuck. This is not good. We may be in trouble here,’” Chabon told The Wrap. “From that meeting until it came out, it was not good after that.”The next bad decision came from Stanton, who decided not to include any references to his Pixar success in the teaser trailer, so people would not associate the movie as being aimed at a younger audience. Neither was there mention of Burroughs, or Chabon, who was at the zenith of his popularity at the time. No powerful sequences were included and neither was Woola, Carter’s Martian dog, “the most distinctive visual element of the movie,” according to Vulture, a potential baby Yoda for the production.Stanton still believed the movie would be successful based on the name alone, but nobody knew who John Carter was, at least not the millions of moviegoers that would have been necessary to justify the production budget. “This is one of the worst marketing campaigns in the history of movies,” a former Disney executive told Vulture. “It’s almost as if they went out of their way to not make us care.”When the movie premiered in February 2012, its stars were the only people unaware that it had already failed. It was not their fault, it wasn’t even that the public had not liked the movie. Simply put, nobody could be bothered to go watch it. Recalling her walk down the red carpet, Collins told The Wrap that Kitsch whispered to her: ‘It’s going to be a fucking disaster.’ Collins’ agent told her she would be blamed. “You’re just going to have to disappear because you’re the one who’s going to get the heat for this. This is just the way the cookie crumbles. Usually that’s what happens.” Fortunately for Collins that was not the case. All of the criticism was leveled at the marketing campaign, carried out by inexperienced executives who swiftly disappeared from Disney.The movie had a budget of $250 million but took only $30 million on its opening weekend, less than half of what would have been considered a minimally acceptable outcome. Stanton was largely unscathed by John Carter: his next production, Finding Dory, grossed over $1 billion worldwide. Kitsch would suffer again with his next big project, Battleship. Collins, whose performance received warm reviews, found refuge in television, and she sacked her agent.Ten years after its release, John Carter is still considered a monumental failure, but not a terrible movie. “John Carter may not be a perfect movie, but it’s one where you can safely plunk down your money, grab your box of popcorn and come away reasonably satisfied when the closing credits roll,” wrote critic Charlie McCollum after its release. Time has proven him right to an extent: the movie’s inclusion on Netflix’s catalog a couple of years ago has reignited interest in Carter’s adventures, and a first video game based on the character is in production. Perhaps one day those sequels will get made after all.'], ['How ‘Future Nostalgia’ has caused present problems for Dua Lipa', '2022-03-09', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-09/how-future-nostalgia-has-caused-present-problems-for-dua-lipa.html', 'The first single from the English singer-songwriter’s hit album, ‘Levitating,’ has attracted two plagiarism lawsuits in just one week', 'Two years ago, when English singer-songwriter Dua Lipa released Levitating from her upcoming album Future Nostalgia (2020), she could never have imagined the trouble it would cause. Nor did she likely expect the global success it ended up being. In the United States, the song reached number one on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. But this did not overshadow the negative side. First, she had to deal with homophobic and sexist remarks made by DaBaby, the rapper who guested on the single; and now, in less than a week, the song has been subject to two accusations of plagiarism.The first band to target the British artist, aged 26, was Artikal Sound System, a reggae group from California. In their lawsuit, they claim that she could not have composed Levitating without inspiration of fragments from Live Your Life, a song released three years earlier. Both songs do indeed share similar chord progressions, typical of pop songs, albeit with a slight distinguishing variation at the end.In the official video of Live Your Life, uploaded to YouTube by Nusoto Records, even the label jokes about the situation, via a pinned comment reading: “Dua Lipa, nothing hears that sound here! [sic]” with a link to another song from the label. The badly written comment could be interpreted as: “Dua Lipa, don’t listen to this!”The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles, is seeking the profits that the artist and label Warner Music have earned from the song, plus compensation for damages. That said, according to data from Google Trends, the band from California had never been as popular as they are since they took the legal action.This week was the turn of composers L. Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer, creators of Wiggle and a Giggle All Night (1979), performed by Cory Daye, as well as the song Don Diablo (1980), which was performed by Miguel Bose (the Spaniard is also listed as one of the composers). In their lawsuit, filed on March 4 in Manhattan, Brown and Linzer allege that Dua Lipa plagiarized the “signature melody” of the song. The plaintiffs argue that this part “is the most listened to and recognizable part, playing a key role in the song’s popularity.” “Because video creators frequently truncate the already brief snippets of sound on TikTok, the signature melody often comprises 50% or more of these viral videos,” the lawsuit continues.Brown and Linzer’s attorneys argue that the artist, while seeking inspiration from vintage sounds for her album, “copied those of the plaintiff’s creation without attribution,” and using a pun in reference to the song title, hold that the composers “have levitated away plaintiff’s intellectual property.” It continues: “Plaintiffs bring suit so that defendants cannot wiggle out of their wilful infringement.” In this second lawsuit, among those named defendants are the rapper DaBaby, besides Dua Lipa and the label.It’s no secret that Dua Lipa found inspiration in retro sounds and disco music in combination with current styles to create her album Future Nostalgia – indeed, this mixture is referenced in the album title. The artist has admitted this in several interviews – hence the accusation of “willful infringement.” In 2018, when she began its development, the artist wanted to fill a gap on the radio, as she told People magazine in an interview, as well as experiment with music that is different from her output up to then. “I wanted to touch on memories that I had growing up listening to music that my parents loved, like Jamiroquai and Blondie and Prince – and recreate them for now. It’s a celebration of being able to be open and vulnerable and to dance and be happy. Dance-crying is very much a thing,” the singer explained at the time.Levitating was the first song created for the album, and was written with the collaboration of three other people: Clarence Coffee Jr., Sarah Hudson and Stephen Kozmeniuk, who also contributed to many other songs from the record. For the star it was “very helpful” to have a song like Levitating, which was the starting point for her creative team to compose the rest of the album. “That song really helped me explain to everyone else – my team and the producers and people that I was working with – like, ‘Okay, this is it …’” Lipa told People. “I felt like it had both elements of the future and nostalgia in it. I just started basing everything off of it. It had to fit in that world and that was the song.”And everything went smoothly. Future Nostalgia became one of the most listened to albums of that year, won the Grammy for best pop album, and Dua Lipa became the most listened to female artist in the world on Spotify, and fourth overall – behind The Weekend, who remain the first, followed by Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber. The overwhelming success of Levitating prompted Lipa to record another version with DaBaby, one of the most popular rappers in the United States. In fact, this version of the song would end up becoming the most played, above the original.But just a few months later, in the middle of a concert at Miami’s Rolling Loud festival on July 25, 2021, DaBaby made sexist and homophobic remarks that became a major embarrassment for Lipa, leading her fans to ask her to remove the collaboration. In an attempt to work up the crowd, the rapper said into the microphone: “If you didn’t show up today with HIV, AIDS, or any of them deadly sexually transmitted diseases, that’ll make you die in two to three weeks, then put your cellphone light up”. He also asked the women in the crowd to turn on their cellphone lights “if your pussy smells like water,” and added: “Fellas, if you’re not sucking dick in the parking lot put your cellphone light up.”DaBaby this is weird to say?? Wth.  pic.twitter.com/MDBQEZ2NsALipa soon came out to apologize for the episode, via her Instagram account: “I’m surprised and horrified at DaBaby’s comments,” she wrote. “I really don’t recognize this as the person I worked with. I know my fans know where my heart lies and I stand 100% with the LGBTQ community. We need to come together to fight the stigma and ignorance around HIV/AIDS.” To date, the artist has not removed the song with the rapper and Levitating continues to accumulate headlines. It will now be up to the US justice system to decide whether they are good or bad.'], ['Rosalía charms Jimmy Fallon’s audience with an anecdote about Harry Styles', '2022-03-11', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-11/rosalia-charms-jimmy-fallons-audience-with-an-anecdote-about-harry-styles.html', 'The singer is touring the United States to promote her new album ‘Motomami,’ which will be released March 18 ', 'Rosalía captivated the United States with El mal querer and Malamente, the song that catapulted her onto the international stage. Now, with the album Motomami, to be released on March 18, she’s here to stay. The Catalan singer has made her first appearances on American television, starting with The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, who admitted to being a fan.Rosalía appeared onstage in a dress from Acne Studios’ F/W 2022 collection. Fallon gave her a warm welcome, though he struggled to pronounce the Spanish star’s name. “I’ve heard so many options, like Rosalina, Rosalita,” the 28-year-old artist said. After showing off the cover of Motomami – censored, as she appears nude and covering her body with both hands – she tried to explain the meaning of the word, as she has been doing on Twitter for days. “Motomami is an energy. Probably you’re a motopapi, too,” she joked.During Rosalía’s brief appearance, she shared a story about an experience she had after she changed her phone number. “I used to do it a lot,” said the singer, who doesn’t answer messages while in the studio in order to stay focused. “I didn’t answer the messages, so I changed the phone for a fresh start.”“I thought when you no longer use a phone number, then that phone number disappears or something,” she confessed, before explaining that her habit had consequences for one of her friends. The singer Harry Styles tried to contact her to congratulate her on one of her songs. She showed Fallon the screenshot of the exchange between the Watermelon Sugar singer and the unknown person who ended up with Rosalía’s old number.“This is so beautiful,” Styles began the conversation, sharing a fragment of the song Dolerme with the person he thought was Rosalía. She answered, “I know my darling. Love you,” to which the Brit responded that he loved her too. The person couldn’t continue with the joke and added, “Haha sorry. I don’t know who you are. This number belonged to someone before. But now it’s my number. So don’t bother me anymore. Good night.” Fallon and Rosalía followed the anecdote with laughter and applause from the audience, who enjoyed the singer’s presence for about eight minutes.Rosalía’s tour in North America is just beginning. On Saturday, March 12, she will be a guest on Saturday Night Live, and as of next week, she will return to her home country for the premiere of her album, which she will present on the Spanish television show El Hormiguero on March 17, a day before its worldwide release.'], ['Rosalía: ‘If success ends up breaking me, well, that’s life’', '2022-03-12', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-12/rosalia-if-success-ends-up-breaking-me-well-thats-life.html?autoplay=1', 'Three years after the success of ‘El Mal Querer,’ the Spanish singer’s new album ‘Motomami’ mixes reggaeton, ballads and just a touch of flamenco. She talks to EL PAÍS about loneliness, critics and finding her new sound', 'Something is glinting in the middle of Rosalía’s smile. It looks like a red heart, but when you get closer you can see the delicate wings: it’s a butterfly. Rosalía, born 29 years ago in Sant Cugat del Vallès, a town north of Barcelona, smiles spontaneously on this Monday morning in February. She has been home for nearly two weeks, and preparations for the release of her new and long-awaited album Motomami are in full swing ahead of the March 18 release date.She is on time. The black van with tinted windows parks in the studios of an industrial building in Barcelona, and she gets out with her partner, Rauw Alejandro. No one was expecting the Puerto Rican singer to be there, but no one had noticed that it was Valentine’s Day either. He gets out first, extending an arm and taking her by the hand, helping her out of the vehicle. She is wearing a baggy pink sweatshirt, light coloured jeans and low white snow boots with fur trim. He sports a black tracksuit and green sneakers, and takes care of the suitcases.Rauw Alejandro will wait out the five-hour session calmly, scrolling on his phone. He is polite and friendly, but does not want to talk about anything Rosalía related. Her little sister Pilar, known as Pili, is always by her side, one of her closest collaborators and an individual she defines as a “visual artist.” “When we were little, we used to draw together and then make dresses. We would cut fabric together. We still do it,” says Rosalía. Pili, who doesn’t want to talk much either, keeps an eye on everything and knows how to get the best out of her little sister, who moves easily through the photo shoot.Rosalía has always set her own pace. She has done it since she arrived at the Taller de Músics music school in Barcelona’s Raval neighborhood aged 16, where founder Lluís Cabrera discovered “a great talent”. An “insatiable” student who played electric guitar and piano, knew jazz and spoke good English, she got into flamenco after listening to Spanish legend Camarón in a friend’s car at the park. “It was super old fashioned and at the same time it was the most modern thing we had heard in 40 years,” Cabrera recalls. Rosalía went on to the Escuela Superior de Música de Cataluña institution and was the top student in flamenco singing. Her final project became El Mal Querer.Three years after that a smash hit that revolutionized Spanish music and catapulted the singer to international fame, all eyes are on her once again. “You’re never late if you go at your own pace,” she remarks. This is how it works: she is a global star, who calculates every movement with huge advertising and promotional campaigns. In a few days she will appear on Saturday Night Live. But she is also an artist capable of transforming herself at an astonishing speed to the needs of every genre she plays. On her new record, Motomami, she goes on an interesting journey with her own voice in different registers. “There are people who think that music can be made by algorithms. One doesn’t make a lyric, distort a voice or choose an asymmetrical structure thinking about numbers. It’s done for the feeling. You look for emotion,” she says.Lights, cameras, wardrobe, background music, catering... There’s not a moment of peace in this warehouse. Rosalía greets us with two kisses and the first thing she does is talk about the new album, the result of three years of work. “It doesn’t feel like it’s been a long time, just the amount of time needed,” she says, while clearly aware of the pressure on her shoulders. Since El Mal Querer, she has joined Sony’s Columbia Records label, whose stable of artists also includes Adele, AC/DC, Bruce Springsteen and Beyoncé.For a Spanish singer, it’s unusual to say the least. Rosa Lagarrigue, director of Spain’s RLM agency, explains: “I think it is very brave of Rosalía and Columbia. I think it was a mixture of chance and luck, but you have to know how to grab luck and how to have the courage to take advantage of it. She has benefited a lot from this agreement and has proven to be more than worthy of the investments made in her. Her career has just taken off and it will be interesting to see where it takes her.”Rosalía says she is taking it one step at a time. But between one album and another, she has kept up a steady stream of hits, collaborating with artists such as J Balvin, Travis Scott and Ozuna, and has guested with the likes of Billie Eilish, Bad Bunny, The Weeknd and Tokischa. But for a world attached to single hits, Motomami is not a compilation, but an ambitious work of 16 songs about Rosalía’s journey over the past three years. “I was very excited that this project was focused. I wanted the album to be like when a photographer captures a moment. Something honest. I was looking for a way to capture my moment,” she says.Rosalía’s moment just keeps growing. “I try to keep myself constantly learning and developing. It’s me and the music,” she says. “Without the main idea, without the need, without the desire, the blood, the sweat, the tears, the time, the energy, the dedication, it is impossible that I would have made this album. It makes me laugh that anyone could think otherwise.”Pedro G. Romero, an influential researcher of flamenco, popular culture and the artistic avant-garde, and the person who recommended the 14th century book that inspired El Mal Querer, remembers how she turned a slightly forgotten genre on its head. “She always said that if Beyoncé or Rihanna could do what they did with soul and blues to turn them into pop, why couldn’t she do the same with flamenco?” She is conscious that not everyone has the space to explore and be hugely popular at the same time. “For me the question is, ‘Wow, did you notice what’s not being talked about?’ There are a lot of women who don’t get the spotlight. There’s Björk, a fabulous artist, who had to fight [to be heard]. There are a lot of women creators who don’t get the credit they deserve. It’s a shame,” she notes.Judeline, a 19-year-old Spanish electrosoul artist, is part of a new generation for whom Rosalía is “a very big inspiration”. “She has paved the way for a lot of people, showing that you can be young and make it big with a different sound and a different way of being. The spotlight is on Spain right now from other parts of the world thanks to her. She knew how to act to reach the US without being mainstream”. Romero agrees: “Many young people have realized that they can take off their provincial overalls and that they don’t have to appear on Radio Olé.”The butterfly is the symbol of Motomami. “A butterfly, I transform myself,” she sings in Saoko, the song that opens the album and that in one month accumulated about 16 million plays on Spotify and as many on YouTube. As David Rodríguez, who worked on the album, says: “she made the decision to transform herself as an artist. A lot of people were maybe counting on El Mal Querer 2. She had a vision to do something different and new.”This transformation has been anticipated since that first reggaeton track with J Balvin, Con Altura. She defends herself when accused of moving away from her flamenco roots. Bulerías is the only flamenco song on Motomami, and she draws a link between earlier reggaeton influences.“Reggaeton is part of my adolescence. In the end, my career is going to be a love letter to the styles of music I love. In the future I will add whatever I come across. Flamenco is something important and my music is very grateful to it, but also to other styles. In music there is no right and wrong, good or bad. What matters is that the music reflects me.” Reggaeton, she adds, doesn’t ask for forgiveness or permission. “That’s why I thought it was a perfect fit for Motomami. In the end, it’s very direct and raw music, and people are not used to celebrating women who speak like that.”The spotlights illuminate Rosalía’s face, which she covers with her hands, partially revealing the twinkling butterfly in her teeth. Her characteristic extra-long false nails are more moderate today, and her jet black hair flutters with her movements. Her body language is extraordinarily powerful and, beyond the aura of fame she exhibits a lot of tenderness. Rosalía naturally introduces words from other languages or dialects, which seemed to cause some anger online when she released 15 seconds of the song Hentai. “I’m exposed to friends from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, the US... I celebrate it. The day it doesn’t happen to me I’m going to worry.”Music critic Diego A. Manrique thinks that what made her special might have been swallowed up by these transatlantic influences. “She was like no one else. In Motomami she is part of a Caribbean trend and her trademark is diluted,” he opines.For the butterfly to be born, a caterpillar must have existed before. The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic caught Rosalía in Miami, in lockdown in the house of her manager, Rebeca León. During the first few weeks of restrictions she worked in a home recording studio. She had never been away from her family for so long.“The pandemic was very hard. I was almost away from my family for two years,” she says. “I was away from the neighborhood where I grew up. Away from my old friends. Far away from everything. I did it to fully commit to my record. It was hard.” She holds one’s gaze, and at times it seems as if she is studying you. The look pierces through, until she drops her eyes to describe even harder moments. “I set deadlines and I never reached them. Then my return home was delayed. There were moments when I was really alone.”She realized how much she missed her family. “I was working 15 or 16 hours a day, but it was really hard. I had a really hard time.” From days in Los Angeles, she confesses, sprung G3, an emotional ballad where she sings, “I’m somewhere I wouldn’t take you.” The song ends with an audio message from her grandmother, also named Rosalía, where she says in Catalan that “family comes first”. Her mother inspired the new album’s title. “My mother has always ridden a motorcycle and I have a very clear image of that. That’s why I’ve been riding a motorcycle for years. I am a motomami because my mother was a motomami, and so was her mother.”She says the album’s name plays on “duality.” Moto in Japanese means “strong” and relates to “aggression”. Mami refers to “fragility”. “The album is like a rollercoaster. It goes up and down. That’s how I feel sometimes.” She ends the album with Sakura, Japanese cherry blossom, with links to spring and femininity. The lyrics are a reflection on the possibility of breaking. “There’s only a risk if there’s something to lose,” she sings. She recalls the first piece of advice her mother gave her. “She told me, whatever I do in life, go for it full on. I don’t remember her words exactly, but I remember how they sounded. She told me that I had to put my all into it.” Before the photo session begins, she admits she is ready for things to get too tough to handle. “This environment is very hostile. It’s difficult to stay in the center of it. For these three years I have searched for my center. If success ends up breaking me over the years, well, that’s life and that’s the journey. Life and death are very close to each other.”'], ['Florida’s controversial anti-gay law sparks Disney censorship scandal', '2022-03-13', 'https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-03-13/floridas-controversial-anti-gay-law-uncorks-disney-censorship-scandal.html', 'Pixar employees claim that company executives have requested the cutting of scenes showing affection between people of the same sex', 'The so-called culture war has sparked a new controversy in the ostensible happiest place on earth.The debate over a controversial anti-rights law in Florida, promoted by Republicans, has caused a scandal at Disney. According to some employees of the media giant, the company was planning to censor LGBTQ+ themed scenes in several of its films. The episode is a reminder that corporate leaders must no longer only deal with external pressure on social issues, but also that demands for change and accountability increasingly come from within the company.According to industry trade magazine Variety, LGBTQ+ Disney employees claimed that executives at the parent company have demanded cuts to “almost every moment of gay displays of affection,” regardless of resistance and protests from the creative teams and leadership within the Pixar studio, which was purchased by the entertainment giant in 2006.“We at Pixar have personally witnessed beautiful stories, full of diverse characters, come back from Disney corporate reviews shaved down to crumbs of what they once were,” states the text addressed to the company’s CEO, Bob Chapek, who came into the position last year, replacing Bob Iger.Chapek said last week that Disney “unequivocally” stood up for minority rights and that they were committed to creating more diverse content. “We all share the goal of living in a more tolerant and respectful world... I believe the best way our company can make lasting change is through the inspiring content we produce,” he said via internal communication channels. “I do not want anyone to confuse the lack of a statement with a lack of support,” added the executive, who was in charge of theme park operations before relieving Iger at the helm of the company.The employees have not cited examples of films whose content was watered down by corporate censorship. In the text addressed to Chapek and Susan Arnold, the chair, the community members say they are “disappointed, hurt, fearful and angry” at the tepid corporate response to the law passed this week by the Republican majority in Florida. The animators’ union also called Disney’s stance “disheartening” and a “misstep” for the corporation.The Parental Rights Act, known in progressive sectors as the “Don’t say gay” law, regulates content in schools on sexual orientation and gender, topics that are weapons in the ideological battlefield between Republicans and Democrats. Governor Ron DeSantis, one of the contenders for the conservative presidential nomination in 2024, will enact it in the coming days. “We’re going to assure parents that they can send their children to kindergarten without some of this stuff injected into their school curriculum,” the local governor said recently. Once it goes into effect, teachers will be prohibited from talking about these topics between kindergarten and the third grade of elementary school.“We expected our company to stand up for us, but it didn’t,” said the statement from the employees, who had hoped Disney would take a tough stance against the Act being pursued in Florida, where the company operates its largest amusement park. Visited by 20 million people each year before the pandemic, this sector generated revenues of $16.5 billion for the company in 2021. There was no public statement against the act. In addition, media reports state that the company has donated money to some of the Republican politicians who supported the initiative.The employees’ statement calls Chapek’s message “hollow”, and goes onto call the company’s conduct hypocritical and cynical: “The parks did not organize gay pride parades until 2019, and only in Paris. Disney has a history of preventing pride events organized by park-goers and, in the 1980s, expelled people of the same sex dancing together,” states the text, which accuses the company of commercially exploiting their segment of society. “It feels terrible to be part of a company that makes money from gay pride march merchandise and decides to step back in a time of need, when our rights are at risk,” they add.The scandal coincides with the company’s announcement to suspend its operations in Russia following the unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin’s troops. Last week, Disney confirmed that it would not release its films in the country, in protest against the military offensive. The decision cancels ongoing content projects and the operation of the tourist cruise ship that the company had docked in a St. Petersburg port. Employees on Russian territory will not be laid off.In 2016, Disney and other industry powerhouses threatened to cancel their projects in the state of Georgia, popular for its tax benefits for film productions, if a law discriminating against homosexual people was passed. The pressure was such that legislators relented. For LGBTQ+ employees, this is a sign that corporate stances by Disney can make a difference. A distinction that has not been extended to them.'], ['Fendi’s Baguette: The most sought-after handbag turns 25 ', '2022-03-22', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-22/fendis-baguette-the-most-sought-after-handbag-turns-25.html', 'In 1997 the Italian brand upended the fashion world with a design that put the accessory center stage. Now, a quarter of a century later, it remains as popular as ever ', 'It is the spring of 1997, and a woman in New York City is asking a man for directions. Instead of replying, he pulls out a gun and steals her handbag and shoes. This scene would not stand out in the Manhattan of the 1990s if it were not for the fact that the woman is Carrie Bradshaw, the character played by Sarah Jessica Parker in the hit TV show Sex and the City. What’s more, hers are no ordinary bag or shoes. The high-heels are by the Spanish designer Manolo Blahnik, and the handbag by the Italian label Fendi. Told to hand over her bag, she replies: “It’s a Baguette!” – surprised by her assailant’s apparent ignorance. The scene is from the third season of Sex and the City, and the 10 million viewers who tuned into each episode learned there is a clear difference between a bag and a Baguette.“I have very sentimental feeling towards the Baguette, as something changed from that moment,” says designer Silvia Venturini Fendi, the heiress of the Italian fashion house. “At a time when bags were highly functional, the creation of the Baguette was a simple, personal desire for a change from traditional bags, originated by dissatisfaction with the 90s minimalism.”In 1997, the same year that Fendi launched the Baguette, music by the Spice Girls was dominating the charts, TV host Ellen DeGeneres had come out of the closet and the world was reeling from the death of Princess Diana. But on the catwalk, the minimalism of designers such as Helmut Lang and Calvin Klein continued to reign supreme.When Fendi released the Baguette, named so in a wink to the image of the French carrying a baguette under their arms, the idea was to put an end to large totes, which until then had been lugged from the office to a date without distinction. With the Baguette, Fendi wanted to make the handbag the star of an outfit. And the concept was such a hit that other designers soon came out with their own versions, such as Dior’s Gaucho and the Stam bag by Marc Jacobs, named after model Jessica Stam. It became a veritable fashion frenzy. “It was a bag with personality and the first bag to have its own name,” says Silvia Venturini Fendi.After making the bag famous, Sex and the City then took it to new heights in a scene where Samantha Jones (played by Kim Cattrall) believes someone has stolen her Baguette in the Playboy mansion, only to be proved wrong and escorted out by Hugh Hefner himself.“Having that bag during the decade of the 2000s was like buying a direct passport into the fashion industry,” says designer Miguel Becer, the creator of the brand ManéMané.And interest in the Baguette has far from waned. In 2019, Parker herself redesigned the iconic item for the Sex and the City reboot And Just Like That…. In 2021, around 20 Italian designers organized a tribute to the compact bag with a show in Rome. And Kim Jones, who has been creative director at Fendi since September 2020, has promised to reinterpret it in different textures and prints every season. As Venturini Fendi explains: “I consider the Baguette a manifesto of individualism because it is always the same but always different, like a blank canvas where you could rewrite history every time.”English version by M.K.\\xa0'], ['Allegra Gucci opens up about her father’s murder: ‘My mother is attracted to darkness’', '2022-03-15', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-15/allegra-gucci-opens-up-about-her-fathers-murder-my-mother-is-attracted-to-darkness.html', 'After 27 years of silence, the 41-year-old has spoken out about the killing of the fashion magnate, who was murdered by a hitman hired by his ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani', 'It’s the most salacious episode of the Gucci fashion house’s 100-plus-year story: the 1995 murder of Maurizio Gucci by a hitman hired by his former wife Patrizia Reggiani. Many books have been written about the killing, and it is also the subject of the Ridley Scott film House of Gucci, starring Adam Driver as Maurizio Gucci and Lady Gaga as Patricia Reggiani.The movie was quickly denounced by the Gucci family, who alleged the filmmakers were “stealing the identity of a family to make a profit, to increase the income of the Hollywood system.” “Our family has an identity, privacy. We can talk about everything, but there is a borderline that cannot be crossed,” Patricia Gucci, one of Maurizio’s second cousins, told Associated Press.The daughters of Gucci and Reggiani – Alessandra and Allegra Gucci – have avoided speaking to the media about the incident that sent their mother to prison for 17 years. When the Italian justice system conceded Reggiani a yearly payment of €1 million ($1.10 million) from Maurizio’s estate, as part of the divorce arrangements, the women remained silent. The two fought the ruling in court, but even though they’ve been the subject of endless headlines, they have refused to speak to the press.Now 41-year-old Allegra Gucci has broken the silence with Fin dei giochi (or, Game Over), a book that relates her version of the story and refutes the official narrative of the Gucci case. Allegra was 11 years old when her mother had a brain tumor operation that changed her personality. When she was 14, her father was murdered, and two years later, her mother was sent to prison for arranging the killing. Little more is known about the fashion magnate’s youngest daughter.Allegra said she decided to publish her version of events in response to the hype caused by the film House of Gucci, which she defined as “an awful caricature.” Speaking to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, she said that she wrote the book so that her two children would grow up knowing the truth about their family. “Scott’s film portrays my father as a weak, broken person. That’s all false. And my mother was a beautiful woman who he sought out. She would never crash a party [as depicted in a scene in House of Gucci]. Papa was brilliant, a hard worker,” she said in the interview.In the book, she recounts the confusion of those years, how their friends abandoned them, the disappointments she faced, her relationship with her grandmother – who she says cared more about money than about her granddaughters –, her experiences visiting her mother in prison and how her understanding of the murder changed after hearing new information on television. “I was sure of her [Reggiani’s] innocence. That intense conviction sustained me as I took packages to prison, the years I spent visiting her, studying the trials, trying to bring to light her innocence once and for all,” she told Corriere della Sera.But her mother’s declarations shook Allegra’s certainties. “I’m not innocent, but I’m not guilty either,” Reggiani said on television. “She half-admitted it. The ‘not guilty’ alluded to the manipulation by people who had taken advantage of her fragility. I called her and asked for an explanation. Finally, she admitted: ‘Everything I did, I did for you two.’ So she had done something. I felt a void beneath my feet, an abyss,” Allegra confessed to Corriere della Sera. “I don’t have any truths, but I do have one certainty: my mother was a good woman, but she was very vulnerable.” In her book, she adds: “My mother is the opposite of a moth. She is attracted to darkness.”Allegra also refutes the idea that her parent’s marriage ended because of Paola Franchi, a former model who became Maurizio Gucci’s partner after the divorce. “The separation dated back at least seven years before his relationship with her,” she told Vanity Fair magazine. “Second: The cohabitation agreement attests to my father’s wish not to get married again. He repeated it to everyone: He would never create a family again because his family was us – my sister and me.”When her mother was found guilty in 1998, Franchi showed up at the children’s court offering to protect the sisters and their interests. “Another slap. I, the daughter of a murdered father and an imprisoned mother, had to suffer this too,” she said in the Vanity Fair interview. “At that moment I also had to think about defending myself, going before a judge to explain what I felt, what was mine in life, to justify myself to avoid another attack. Paola Franchi has never given us respite. And she continued. I don’t understand how you can throw yourself at a little girl like that. Or maybe I know: She was looking for some reward because her actions are contrary to her professed intentions of care and love.”In her book, Allegra also discusses her memories of her grandmother, Silvana Barbieri, with whom she and her sister lived after their mother’s arrest. Later they discovered that Barbieri had hidden part of the money meant for them and transferred it to her own account. She also put one of the family’s mansions, which the sisters continued paying, into her own name. “I trusted her blindly. But I soon realized that, for Silvana, there was only money and the power that comes with it. She manipulated us with feelings of guilt. And she manipulated others with her acquired economic power,” Allegra told Vanity Fair.'], ['Sensuality and a mechanical bull: Rosalía’s music video for the provocative ‘Hentai’', '2022-03-18', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-18/sensuality-and-a-mechanical-bull-rosalias-music-video-for-the-provocative-hentai.html', 'The song is the fourth track to be released from the Catalan singer’s latest album ‘Motomami,’ which comes out on March 18', \"Just two months ago, on January 16, Spanish singer Rosalía gave the world a preview of the song Hentai, a ballad from her new album Motomami, which comes out on March 18. In the 24-second clip, shared on TikTok, the pop star sang a part of the track as she traveled up a cable car in the snow. The overtly sexual nature of the lyrics, with phrases such as “Te quiero ride / Como a mi bike” or “I want to ride you like my bike,” made it clear the singer was taking a new direction from her album El Mal Querer (2018), which shot her to global fame.The lyrics, co-written by Pharrel Williams – the singer behind hits such as Blurred Lines and Get Lucky – Rosalía and her sister Pilar, feature a more urban vocabulary than the singer’s previous work, and also more Spanglish. They are also filled with sexual and sensual imagery, a pattern that is also seen in the music video for the song.Directed by Mitch Ryan, the music video begins with Rosalía in a green field, bathed in golden sunlight. As the song progresses, the light fades until it is nighttime. That’s when the singer climbs on top of a mechanical bull and sings: “Lo segundo es chingarte / Lo primero es Dios” or “Second is fucking you / First is God.”The other scene in the music video is in an American rodeo, where Rosalía lies on a bed in the middle of the ring. She twists and turns on the mattress, while a white horse stands in the background, then crawls on the orange-red dirt.Hentai is one of several slow songs included in Motomami, an album that showcases Rosalía’s vocal range and powerful falsetto. The song becomes more industrial and aggressive as the song progresses, while string instruments and an explosive percussion build on the piano chords.This is the fourth music video to be released from Motomami, following La Fama, Rosalía’s bachata with Canadian artist The Weeknd, Saoko and Chicken Teriyaki. Two days ahead of the release, the Catalan singer shared a video of herself reciting the lyrics of the track, as though it were a poem. It was a daring sneak peek, not without controversy, which showed Rosalía was capable of mixing sex and religion in the same ballad..@Rosalia hace una lectura de la letra de 'HENTAI' vía Tiktok. pic.twitter.com/hahptNuJF7\"], ['Ed Sheeran copyright case: Musician denies plagiarizing hook of ‘Shape of You’', '2022-03-09', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-09/ed-sheeran-copyright-case-musician-denies-plagiarizing-hook-of-shape-of-you.html?autoplay=1', 'The British pop star sang in court in a bid to demonstrate how different songs can have similar melodies if they have the same scale and rhythm', '“Everything that is not tradition is plagiarism.” That’s according to the famous aphorism by Spanish writer Eugenio d’Ors i Rovira. It’s a sentiment that’s become surprisingly relevant in today’s constant court battles over copyright infringement in music. The latest artist to take to the stand in one such copyright trial is British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, who appeared in London’s High Court on Tuesday over allegations he deliberately plagiarized the hook of his smash hit Shape of You.Musicians Sami Chokri, who goes by the artist name of Sami Switch, and Ross O’Donoghue argue that Sheeran copied the “Oh I” hook of Shape of You from their song Oh Why. Released in 2017, Shape of You was the highest-selling song of that year and it remains the most-played track in the history of Spotify, with more than 3 billion streams. But since Chokri and O’Donoghue filed the lawsuit in 2018, royalties linked to Shape of You, which are estimated at €24 million ($26.5 million), have been frozen.“I have always tried to be completely fair in crediting anyone who makes any contribution to any song I write,” Sheeran told the court on Tuesday. “I do refer to other works on occasion when I write, as do many songwriters. If there is a reference to another work, I notify my team so that steps can be taken to obtain clearance.”Indeed the 31-year-old artist had no issue with admitting that Shape of You incorporated some of the chord progressions and rhythm of the song No Scrubs by TLC. Sheeran, however, denied having any prior knowledge of the track Oh Why when he composed his famous song.The barrister for the prosecution, Andrew Sutcliffe QC, who is known for his ruthlessness in the courtroom, accused the pop star of listening to Oh Why on the YouTube channel of SBTV: Music, a London-based platform for emerging artists, and of learning of their work through mutual friends. The barrister argued that while Sheeran has had no problem in recognizing the contributions of famous music stars such as Rihanna, Jay-Z and Coldplay, he treated lesser-known artists differently. Sutcliffe told the court that Sheeran “borrows ideas and throws them into his songs, sometimes he will acknowledge it but sometimes he won’t.”Chokri and O’Donoghue claim that Sheeran completely plagiarized the hook to their song – “Oh why, oh why” – in Shape of You, which goes “Oh I.., oh I.” “It was a phrase you already had in your head after listening to the chorus of Sami’s song Oh Why, wasn’t it?” insisted Sutcliffe, who played excerpts from the Shape of You recording sessions. In one recording, Sheeran insists on changing the hook because it was “a bit close to the bone.” When asked about this in court, the singer replied: “We thought it was a bit too close to a song called No Diggity by Blackstreet.”This is not the first time that the British pop star has had to address allegations of supposed plagiarism in court or in out-of-court settlements. Composers Thomas Leonard and Martin Harrington received a payment of $5 million and 35% of the gross publishing revenues Sheeran’s song Photograph, which sounded similar to Amazing, a track the two had written for Matt Cardle, the former winner of X-Factor.English version by M.K.'], ['Is your cholesterol\\xa0level a death sentence? Avoid the trap of marketing gimmicks', '2022-03-20', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-20/is-a-cholesterol-level-over-200-a-death-sentence-antiquated-ideas-about-cholesterol-and-food.html', 'You may have heard about “functional foods” or be concerned about dairy products, but readings of the blood lipid are only useful when understood in relation with other variables ', 'We’ve all been born under the stigma of cholesterol. From the day you were born, the cholesterol in your food and your blood cholesterol levels have determined your health prognosis.Though it remains poorly understood, cholesterol continues to play a central role as a dietary indicator. Concerns about cholesterol have given rise to the creation of functional foods, shaped food advertising, dictated the principles behind dietary guides and influenced our dietary habits.The story of the study of cholesterol begins two centuries ago, and it has been influential in places as disparate as Tsarist Russia, post-war Japan and the United States. Studies about blood lipids and related diseases have won at least 11 Nobel prizes.The issue of pharmacological treatments for high cholesterol has become the subject of passionate debates, among them a recent confrontation between the British Medical Journal and The Lancet. So it’s no surprise if you disagree with your doctor about cholesterol.From a strictly chemical perspective, cholesterol is a molecule that belongs to the sterol family. It s found exclusively in the tissue and blood plasma of vertebrates, and certain levels are vital for human health. In normal conditions, though, all organisms are capable of generating all the cholesterol they need. The highest concentrations of cholesterol in the human body are found in the liver, spinal cord and brain.Cholesterol forms part of all our cell membranes. It helps our bodies synthesize vitamin D, bile, steroid hormones including cortisol, cortisone and aldosterone, and the sexual hormones progesterone, estrogen and testosterone. They also play an important role in brain synapses and even in immune system function. Finally, cholesterol can also form deposits on the walls of our arteries under certain conditions, leading to the well-known condition atherosclerosis. That can be a risk factor for many different cardiovascular conditions, including coronary heart disease.In the 1950s, groundbreaking epidemiological studies began to observe the role of fatty diets in contributing to blood lipid concentration, atherosclerosis and and cardiovascular risk. One of the most known studies was the famous Seven Countries Study, which catapulted Ancel Keys to fame and popularized the Mediterranean diet. The NIH also began the Framingham Heart Study, which continues today and has published over 3,000 scientific papers.In 1964, Konrad Bloch described how the body metabolizes and regulates cholesterol and fatty acids, a work that won him the Nobel Prize in medicine. Three years later, Donald Fredrickson discovered that not all lipoproteins work the same for everyone. He opened up the possibility for genetics to play a role in developing prognostics for cardiovascular health.By 1973, Arno Motulsky and Joseph Goldstein had developed the foundations for the first genetic classification of hyperlipidemia, or high blood lipid concentration. Three years later, Akira Endo discovered the first statins, substances that have become protagonists in pharmacological treatments for hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. The first treatment was approved for commercial use in the United States in 1987. Since then, scientists have made many advances in their understanding of atherosclerosis, from the role of genetics and diet to factors like tobacco and exercise, in addition to the developments in pharmacology.Eighty to 90% of cholesterol that circulates in the blood is synthesized within our own bodies. The rest comes from cholesterol ingested in food. But saturated and trans-saturated fats contribute more to cardiovascular risk than cholesterol.Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disease that causes especially high levels of cholesterol. It often occurs because the liver does not completely eliminate cholesterol because it lacks LDL receptors. More than half of familial hypercholesterolemia patients present symptoms of the illness before 55 years of age.While blood cholesterol levels have long been used as a health indicator, the metric can have little to no relevance to overall health. Though advertisements for products such as Danone’s Danacol yogurt warn of grave consequences if blood cholesterol surpasses 200 mg/dl, in reality, it is only useful when understood in relation with other variables.Many people find themselves conflicted between their concerns about high cholesterol and their consumption of milk and dairy products. Dietary recommendations to consume a certain quantity of milk everyday are outdated. Fortunately, we no longer need to drink milk to fulfill our nutritional needs.Dairy products or milk often are less the problem than the other foods that they tend to accompany: bread, cookies, breakfast cereals, chocolates high in sugar. If you do drink milk, up-to-date dietary recommendations suggest choosing fat-free milk, though the most current research points to the benefits of fermented milk products like yogurt above milk itself.We do know, though, that cardiovascular risk depends on many more important factors than the cholesterol levels. One of those elements is the quantity and kind of LDL lipoproteins. Your doctor can use software to interpret that data if you require a more detailed analysis.Your doctor’s advice will truly help you understand your cardiovascular risk. To focus only on your cholesterol is to disregard the last 70 years of scientific research—and to fall into the trap of marketing gimmicks like “functional foods.”The dietary guidelines to prevent heart disease are the same ones recommended to prevent cancer or diabetes. Keep these principles in mind:-Focus on healthy foods and dietary patterns, not on individual nutrients.-Move towards a vegetable-based diet, and avoid ultra processed foods that are dense in energy, salt, sugar and saturated and trans-saturated fats.-The key ingredients of a health diet are fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish, low-fat dairy products and vegetable oils.-Remember that, in addition to strictly dietary issues, physical inactivity and habits like tobacco usage and alcohol consumption will also increase your cardiovascular risk.-Age and genetics also have an impact on your cardiovascular health.'], ['From the highest-paid actor in Hollywood to straight-to-video B-movies: The rise and fall of Bruce Willis', '2022-03-07', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-07/from-the-highest-paid-actor-in-hollywood-to-straight-to-video-b-movies-the-rise-and-fall-of-bruce-willis.html', 'In the last eight years, the actor has made 29 films, 23 of which never made it to the cinema. The parody award show the Razzies has also given the actor his own category for ‘worst performance’ ', 'In 2013, Rocky star Sylvester Stallone described Bruce Willis as “greedy and lazy,” adding that this was a “sure formula for career failure.” Stallone had offered Willis $3 million for three days’ work on The Expendables 3, and Willis had asked for $1 million more. Almost a decade later, Stallone’s observation seems the only possible explanation for Willis’s fall. Once the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, the Die Hard star now has his own category in the annual Golden Raspberry Awards, a parody award show – also known as the Razzies – that honors cinematic under-achievements. The category is “Worst Bruce Willis Performance in a 2021 movie.” There are eight candidates. All of the films went straight to video. How did it come to this?Perhaps it all started at some point in the 2000s. Willis was already showing signs of tiring of fighting against his destiny, of having the critics against him and the public on his side only when playing underdogs in action movies. The only thing left was to exactly that; the kind of cinema that was expected of him. He started to accept parts in generic action thrillers, acting with an earpiece so that he wouldn’t have to learn his lines.Willis’s last attempt to claw back some prestige was in 2015. Having started out in off-Broadway productions, after 30 years without cracking the boards, he returned to theater in an adaptation of Misery. The critics shot down his performance with adjectives such as “inert” and “empty.” Since then, Willis has been staunchly a straight-to-DVD actor. In an industry dominated by franchises, Willis decided he could become one, with Randall Emmett as the wholesale manufacturer of the product.Crossing paths with the producer was the worst thing that has happened to Willis’s career, but the best thing that has happened to his bank account. According to industry website Vulture, Emmett has developed a system for mass-producing movies in which he gathers together a team of people looking to embellish their CV, convinces a veteran star (John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Al Pacino, Robert de Niro, Steven Seagal, etc) to put in a couple of days’ work for $1 million and then uses their face on the promotional posters to land international distribution deals. The star tends to appear in just three scenes, at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the movie. In Hard Kill, Willis is on screen for a total of seven minutes; in Extraction, eight, and in Survive the Night, just under 10.In the last eight years, Willis has made 29 movies, 20 of which were Emmett productions. Twenty-three went straight to domestic viewing platforms and 16 have a less-than 10% approval rating on viewer-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. While he would surely accept meatier roles if they were offered, the industry doesn’t seem to know quite what to do with him, leaving Willis with a choice of kicking his heels at home or making easy money on movies where he is still the king. Most veterans are increasingly choosing the second option.It is rumored Willis has financial issues that leave him with little choice but to accept such roles, much like Cage, De Niro and Pacino. The B-movie industry represents quick cash. A Hollywood production, which would pay considerably more, may take years to put together. One of Emmett’s movies can be set in motion within weeks. And the prolific producer isn’t concerned about annoying his investors, directors or screenwriters, while shaving every available dollar off costs. A producer who worked with Emmett told The New York Magazine that projects involving Willis have “a bullying kind of exploitative nature” because shooting days are reduced when the movie is in production. On Out of Death, Willis decided to cut his contribution from two days to one, leaving the director to squeeze as many scenes out of him as he could.“Why does Bruce Willis keep making films he clearly hates?” asked Esquire magazine in 2020. Willis has always seen himself as an outsider with the system against him, according to people close to him in a 1991 Vanity Fair profile. When he was young Willis was painfully shy and had a stutter, an affliction the theater cured him of, he told journalist David Sheff in 1996. From there, Willis shaped his persona around his physique: a sardonic, ironic guy who didn’t give a damn. That is the persona that the public subsequently came to know as Bruce Willis, and throughout his career, he has played various versions of himself. The first was in the TV show Moonlighting, his big break.The show’s executives wanted an established star, so Willis had to do 11 auditions to convince them of his suitability. During the final one, a woman stood up and said: “I don’t know if he’s a leading man or not, but he looks as though sleeping with him is fucking with danger.” He got the part.However, despite the success of Moonlighting, two box-office bombs helmed by Blake Edwards, Blind Date and Sunset, as well as his decision to release a record called The Return of Bruno, turned Willis into a running joke for the intellectual elite. Willis was an atypical, modern leading man, a blue-collar rogue who Hollywood had admitted but would never let him forget he was there on borrowed time. When he was paid $5 million for Die Hard, the biggest paycheck ever in Hollywood at the time, the industry and the media went wild. “If Willis gets $5 million,” wondered The New York Times, “how much for [Robert] Redford?”The distributor of Die Heard, 20th Century Studios, insisted Willis was worth it. Only he was able to carry off an action hero who had walked in off the street, so hapless and cynical that he seemed to nod to the fact he was in a movie. In Die Hard 2, Willis’s character John McClane asks: “How can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?”Unlike Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger, Willis’s muscles appeared vulnerable, as though every hit genuinely hurt. Three years after the hugely successful Die Hard, the media were eager to announce the end of his career. The failures of The Bonfire of the Vanities, The Last Boy Scout and, above all, Hudson Hawk, which he co-wrote, seemed to confirm that Die Hard and Die Hard 2 had been a lucky swing. Willis became hostile to the press, which he said was bent on bringing him down. It was not entirely without basis. Reporters described him as “a star who eats with his hands” and “an actor who has made a fortune because Hollywood has become a corporation.” He adopted a defensive strategy in interviews, rehearsing his responses not to give anything away, to maintain the public image of Bruce Willis, to make sure he didn’t stutter.His career was resurrected in 1994, when Quentin Tarantino cast him in Pulp Fiction. However, despite the movie’s huge success, Pulp Fiction started a pattern in Willis’s career from then on: even when he was in a hit, the press would focus on other aspects of the movie. In this case, that focus was Travolta, whose own resurrection at the hand of Tarantino eclipsed Willis. Six years later, when The Sixth Sense was well-received by critics and at the box office, all the talk was of newcomers M. Night Shyamalan and Haley Joel Osment, as though the movie was a success in spite of Willis, not because of him.More hits followed: The third Die Hard installment and Armageddon, which were the highest-grossing movies of 1995 and 1998, respectively. These served to confirm that what the public wanted to see was Bruce Willis playing Bruce Willis. Still, he had to hide the fact that he craved the respect of critics, that he had artistic concerns and that he wanted to show his versatility as an actor. Willis has one of the most varied filmographies in Hollywood. Between 1992 and 1999 he played a surgeon in Death Becomes Her, an imaginary friend dressed as the Easter bunny in North, a gangster in Last Man Standing, a time-traveling convict with paranoia issues in 12 Monkeys and a car salesman on the verge of a nervous breakdown in Breakfast of Champions. He even played himself in a parodic light in The Player. In none of those productions was he the director’s first choice for the role – he had to fight for the parts and take a pay cut to make the movies.Perhaps through so much pretending not to give a damn, Bruce Willis has ended up genuinely not giving a damn. When all is said and done, the movies Willis makes now only exist so that Bruce Willis fans get to see Bruce Willis in movies. As actor Michael Caine famously said of his participation in the universally panned Jaws: The Revenge, which has an approval rating of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes: “I have never seen it, but by all accounts, it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built for my mum, and it is terrific.”English version by Rob Train.'], ['Bad Gyal: ‘There’s no need to go telling people what you think of their body’', '2022-03-18', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-18/bad-gyal-theres-no-need-to-go-telling-people-what-you-think-of-their-body.html', 'The Spanish-born singer has just finished recording an album in Miami. EL PAÍS talked to her in Paris, where she explained what her influences are and how she handles herself in the urban music industry', '“I’ve tried a lot of shit looks. I mean, I’ve got it wrong a lot, but by trying different things I’ve found my personality,” Bad Gyal (whose real name is Alba Farelo i Solé) tells EL PAÍS in Paris, in the dressing room where she is getting ready for the photo session that goes with this article. She has just returned to Europe from Miami, where for the past month she has been recording an album with Scott Storch, who has produced Dr. Dre, Nas, Pink and Lil’ Kim, as well as Nely aka “El Arma Secreta” (The Secret Weapon) who has penned reggaeton hits for Daddy Yankee and Don Omar. Gyal says she feels “grateful and very lucky. I’m aware that exploiting my body for my work is part of my character, that I have put myself in this position and that people are going to have an opinion, but what I can’t tolerate is people telling me what I should do with it all the time.”Gyal understand the celebration of her sexuality as a tool of empowerment, as well as a marketing instrument. “A few years ago, I was in a moment in my life when nothing motivated me to make me love myself, and then I found some dancehall videos on YouTube, a Jamaican dance that had little to do with me but that I immediately identified with.” Dancehall, she says, gave her the confidence she lacked, a confidence that seeing her pose for the camera it is hard to imagine she ever lacked. “Something clicked and I said to myself: ‘I’m going to exploit being pretty and I’m going to learn how to move my ass.”Social media criticism has revolved around Gyal’s appearance, and the fact she has become famous for being as brazen in her twerking as she is in her songwriting. “I’m too thin, I need a boob job… just leave me alone! And if I want to put on 10 kilos, you’ll have my fat ass waving in your face. In 2022 we should have learned that there’s no need to go telling people what you think of their body.” Even so, Gyal says she has learned not to waste her “sacred energy” on social media spats or to let “the opinion of four assholes” get her down.Gyal’s image is part of the product she sells and part of its success, and fashion is a fundamental piece of the process. She says she discovered the world of brands and models through EL PAÍS – “I swear, I’m not ass-kissing” she adds – and when her father gave her pocket money she would use it to buy Vogue magazine. She started studying design while working as a telemarketer, a babysitter, a waitress or whatever came her way. Then her first gigs began to crowd her schedule and she just dedicated herself to music. A career that seemed unlikely when she posted a Catalan cover of Rihanna’s Work online in 2016, titled Pai. But the song worked and she began recording others such as Fiebre and Indapanden, without the support of a record label, which would not arrive until 2019. Then followed hit singles Hookah and Zorra and collaborations that brought her to the attention of a wider audience: she worked with Rauw Alejandro, El Guincho, Khea and Kafu Banton, a Panamanian dancehall musician with a homophobic song, Pato, that obliged the Spaniard to apologize for working with him. “For people who listen to dancehall and Caribbean music its nothing new that the genre has a lot of homophobic and sexist history behind it,” she says. “I want to emphasize that I am against those values and I apologize again.”Although she has always been very visceral about fashion – “I’ve had my posh phase and my hippy phase” – Gyal says she has been “educated” thanks to the team she works with and her relationship with brands such as Loewe, Coperni and Marine Serre. Last year she also launched a capsule collection in collaboration with Bershka. “I like to surround myself with talented people who share my vision and who I can learn from. People I can get feedback from in music and fashion.” Her references and her wardrobe are influenced by the past and the present, as is the music she is listening to at the moment (“I’m interested in the old stuff from the 2000s”) and the influence of the early years of the new millennium is evident. “Britney in the old days / I’m original she’s a phony” she sings in Spanish on Flow 2000.“The divas at that time were real divas, they were much freer and they exploited their personality to the maximum. That’s my thing. I loved Beyoncé, in terms of beauty, being a goddess and her music. My aunt gave me a Destiny’s Child CD and I freaked out. What touches you when you’re a kid stays with you forever. I liked Fergie a lot too. I’ve never really been into the basic stuff.”Gyal is anything but basic but still, in her musical world it is difficult to stand out or build a recognizable identity when almost all of its stars are devotees of the holy trap trinity: hair, huge fingernails and bare midriff. “That’s normal. Fashion affects us all. But I think it’s good to express yourself in an original way through clothes. To not be all the same, copies of one another. Obviously, we can all be sexy, but how many layers of sexy are there?”In the endless line to get into the Marine Serre show, Gyal wears an outfit of the style popularized by Alicia Silverstone in the 1997 teen comedy Clueless, with shiny oversized earrings on which a toucan could perch. Short skirt, big earrings: it’s the new centennial credo. “I spend more money on old clothes than new clothes: Versace, John Galliano, Tom Ford… In the urban music industry, you have to be ready to stand up for yourself, to say no and to prove yourself all the time. I write my own songs, but there’s always someone ready to tell me what to say. But while he’s still thinking about it, I’ve written the intro, the verses and I’m on the chorus. People think you’re capable of doing much less than you really can. But it’s also funny to see their faces when they see what a writing machine you are.”Gyal says she has few friends in the industry. The ones she considers friends have been with her from the start, like her assistant. “I know there are people who are friendly, I am friendly with everybody. But if one day I needed something, I couldn’t give you the name of a single artist I could call.”Perhaps her defensive and combative spirit is, as she acknowledges, what drives her creative process: instinctive and spontaneous, sometimes to kamikaze extremes. “I get to the studio with nothing prepared, but when I’m there I let it all out. It’s like writing a diary when you’re a kid.” She records voice notes with ideas that come to her in case one day she doesn’t know what to talk about. But nothing about her is premeditated, she insists. “When I wrote the lyrics for Pussy: ‘All of my people pay for their Rémy Martin / Social distancing, we’ll kick you out of here,’ I did it without thinking. Later I realized it was a positive message, although people might think it’s obscene.”However, while in Miami, Gyal started to think about what she wants to say before opening her mouth, so as not to repeat herself. To have more layers. To avoid being pigeonholed. “On this album I collected what I heard, and I listen to everything and everyone: rhythms from Martinique; brega, which is a new genre in Brazil; northern African music, afroswing, Boricua son. What I have in my head is reflected in my songs and how I dress, and right now I’m very into the 2000s, inside and out.”'], ['Carl Icahn: The road from ‘corporate raider’ to animal welfare activist', '2022-03-23', 'https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2022-03-23/carl-icahn-the-road-from-corporate-raider-to-animal-welfare-activist.html', 'HBO recently premiered a documentary about the New York investor who became famous for his confrontations with the boards of the companies that he controls', 'An oil painting of Napoleon’s Battle of Friedland hangs at the offices of billionaire investor Carl Icahn on New York’s Fifth Avenue. It is an image painted by Ernest Meissonier about the victory of French troops over the Russians, a decisive triumph for the Bonaparte empire. One of Wall Street’s most feared sharks, a man who has bankrupted and reawakened companies, counting dozens of CEOs amongst his victims, and someone who has amassed immense wealth through the arts of boardroom intrigue, makes a reflection: Napoleon was undoubtedly a great strategist but he lost everything to arrogance. “It doesn’t stay forever if you’re not careful,” says Icahn in a recently premiered documentary.Carl Icahn: The Restless Billionaire –an HBO documentary– is a portrait of one of the most influential and feared men in the US market. The investor rejects the “corporate raider” label, coined by the specialized media who made him famous in the 1980s. With a net worth of around $16 billion, Icahn prefers the term “activist investor,” someone willing to work on behalf of the small shareholders. His work revolves around driving the necessary changes, however painful these may be, at the top management in companies in order to increase their value. This strategy, implemented since the 2000s, has allowed him to reach a spot in Forbes’ top 50 richest list (at number 43). His company employs over 20,000 people with about $10 billion in annual revenues.Bruce David Klein, a documentary filmmaker, clarifies that Icahn, 86, has never feared a confrontation within a management board, the billionaire’s battleground for decades. At the origins of his story, in the late 1970s, is his takeover attempt on Tappan, a kitchen appliances manufacturing company. The son of a schoolteacher and a synagogue cantor, Icahn was a student with an unfinished medical degree as well as a successful broker specializing in options trading, and he devised a strategy to remove Tappan’s CEO, who was finalizing the acquisition of a rival. The hostile shareholder labeled the deal a disaster and convinced board members that the share price, then seven dollars, was below its potential. Time proved him right when the Swedish company Electrolux bought Tappan a few months later for about $18 per share.Today, at 86, Icahn is far from retirement. His days begin with several hours of exhaustive reading of the press. Although cameras capture him playing tennis at his exclusive mansion in the Hamptons, on the East Coast, there is a phone with several lines next to him whenever he appears seated in the documentary. His wife, Gail Golden, describes him as a “bulldog” who does not stop until he gets what he wants. He prefers to sum up his vision in a word with a strong Queens accent: winning. A mindset tying him to Donald Trump, under whom the billionaire served as a special advisor during Trump’s presidency until mid-2017.The media continues to provide detailed reports of his most recent movements. Most recently he exited the energy company Occidental after three years of investment, generating over $1 billion in profits. A few days ago, he took on a proxy fight against McDonald’s, buying 200 shares in the burger company and nominating two women who are experts in sustainability to its board of directors. Icahn has set a goal of holding the restaurant chain to the commitment it made a decade ago to end the use of large-scale pig farms that mistreat pregnant animals. It remains to be seen how successful he will be in this latest venture. In the last year, McDonald’s has seen its share price grow by 18%. The fast-food chain is far from sailing the same troubled waters as the companies that Icahn the pirate usually raids.A lifetime devoted to investment has taken him to multiple industries and companies such as Hertz, Netflix, eBay, Texaco, Uniroyal, Caesars casinos and Tropicana, besides MGM Studios and Lions Gate, among many others. He has never been without controversy. In the mid-1980s he was able to put the advice he kept for others to the test when he became president of TWA. The experience was one of his worst failures. In 1992, the airline declared bankruptcy after having the flight attendants’ union as the company’s main adversary.Another episode of failure came during his time in Marvel, one of the most recognized brands today. Icahn held a battle against Ronald Perelman, another Wall Street titan who also earned a reputation as a corporate raider after shifting the fortune of cosmetics giant Revlon. In 1989, Perelman bought Marvel, which had 70% of the market, for $82 million. His management was a disaster. The clash of egos led to a series of cutbacks resulting in the dismissal of artists and writers, diluting the quality of the comics and causing fans to turn their backs on them. In 1996, the company held only 25% of the market, having to file for bankruptcy by the end of that year. “The only thing Icahn achieved was a toxic trading of insults [with Perelman],” points Dan Raviv, a journalist, in his book Comic Wars. A few years later, Marvel would star in one of the most successful comebacks in decades.His closeness to Donald Trump has added to his controversy in recent years. In 2019, federal authorities launched an investigation to determine whether Icahn had benefited from insider information following his role as a White House advisor (for which he did not receive a salary). In early 2018, his firm sold $30 million worth of his stake in crane manufacturer Manitowoc. The operation happened months before Trump’s administration imposed new tariffs on U.S. steel imports. Icahn rejected the allegations. In the documentary, the millionaire explains on camera what many consider a stroke of luck in the game of capitalism. “Frankly, I made this money because the system is so bad. Not because I’m a genius.”'], ['Five great films for cinephiles hidden away on Amazon Prime', '2022-03-18', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-18/five-great-films-for-cinephiles-hidden-away-on-amazon-prime.html', 'We are diving into streaming platforms in search of cinematic jewels. On this second voyage, we find great directors such as Joseph Losey and Agnès Varda', 'Every streaming platform that has movies projects the image that it wants to of itself. However, hidden away on these services there are always films that lie on the margins of this image, and for some viewers are even more interesting than the mainstream fare. In the case of Amazon Prime, there is something strange going on: there appears to be no attempt to create any image at all. There are legendary titles mixed with some that are almost unknown, not to mention seemingly endless bargain-basement fare. That said, if only by virtue of the sheer volume of content, there are some good things to choose from.The ordering is also not exactly the strong point of Amazon, and even less so given that the search option only works with specific names of directors and actors. If you try typing in something like “1950s films” or “Oscar winners,” you won’t find what you’re looking for. So, after our first installment in the series about Netflix, this week we’re back with a list of recommendations from Amazon’s bottom drawer.Adua and Her Friends (1960, dir. Antonio Pietrangeli).The impossibility of escaping the mark that society has left on a woman – in the case of this film, a prostitute. When the Merlin law is passed in 1950s Italy, making brothels illegal, the consequence was that sex workers had to get out onto the cold and rainy streets in order to still make a living. Director Antonio Pietrangeli tells the story here of four woman who try to rebuild their lives by running a restaurant, with plans to offer sexual services in the rooms upstairs. But as the film shows, the system, the one run by men, always ends up grinding them down.Accident (1967, dir. Joseph Losey).Among the three powerful scripts that Harold Pinter wrote for director Joseph Losey – The Servant (1963), Modesty Blaise (1966) and The Go-Between (1971) – the second is perhaps the most abstract and complex. The story of four young students at Oxford and two university professors is captured by Losey as if it were intellectual, alcoholic and sexual combat, with moments that are practically experimental in terms of narration, mise-en-scène and editing. The print that is available on Amazon was restored by the British Film Institute.Cléo from 5 to 7 (1962, dir. Agnès Varda).The film portrays the painful uncertainty of a woman who is awaiting medical tests that could confirm terminal cancer. Two hours of existence – 90 minutes, in the real time of the film – in which the loneliness of the protagonist – despite her always being surrounded by people – is exposed with a unique fusion of the profound and the light-hearted. Varda shows the viewer the characters vertigo, both physical and psychological, via a movie that is in perpetual movement, with two sentences that encapsulate her spirit: “Everyone takes care of me, but nobody loves me;” and: “It seems that I no longer am afraid, it seems I am happy.” From suffering to hope.The Grissom Gang (1971, dir. Robert Aldrich).During the Great Depression, and in the midst of Prohibition, a band of criminals made up by a matriarch and her four children kidnap the daughter of a millionaire with the aim of demanding a ransom and then killing her. But the youngest falls in love with the girl, something that becomes at once a problem for the family and a lifeline for the victim. The director of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? made this movie in his own studio, but the amorality and ambiguity of the end result were too much for the general public.Playtime (1967, dir. Jacques Tati).At the end of the 1960s, with his subtle and muted humor, Jacques Tati was a cineaste before his time. In Playtime, his character Monsieur Hulot comes face to face with the technology of civilization. With the exception of Jerry Lewis, no one else could have made such dazzling comedy out of something so mundane as a person sitting in a modern chair in an office building.English version by S.

It’s the third movie, along with Reprise (2006) and Oslo, August 31st (2011), in his so-called “Oslo Trilogy.” As well as being set in the Norwegian capital, the movie also follows the same narrative process of those two films: observing one single life under a microscope until an understanding is gained about what makes it at once unique and universal. “I wanted to return to my beginnings, to the time of my first project Reprise, which I filmed 15 years ago. Repeating myself scared me, but I told myself that at my age, I had a right to,” says Trier, 47, in a video call from his home in Oslo.The Worst Person in the World, which is nominated for the Oscar for Best International Feature Film and Best Original Screenplay, is a portrait in 12 chapters of Julie, a slightly lost twentysomething who keeps making career changes (doctor, psychologist, photographer) as quickly as she changes boyfriends. But in Aksel, a brilliant if somewhat self-centered cartoonist, she has found the perfect partner. That is, if it were not for the age difference: he is at a stage where he wants children, but she doesn’t feel ready yet. Their relationship is tested with the arrival of Eivind, a young waiter with no grand pretensions in life. He becomes Julie’s lover, and in one scene worthy of a Stanley Donen musical, she is seen running across the city to meet him as the rest of the world stands still. “It was a good moment to film this movie,” says Trier. “I have enough experience and I have been on both sides: I have been the young person who doesn’t want kids and the older man who begins to feel the need for children and a home. I have been Aksel, but also Julie.”The Worst Person in the World can be seen as a new twist on the traditional romantic comedy, a genre which in the hands of Trier – who is considered one of the leading directors of European art film along with Yorgos Lanthimos, Ruben Östlund and Mia Hansen-Løve to name a few – becomes bitter or even tragic. “Many of the great films in the history of cinema can be seen as romantic comedies, from The Philadelphia Story by George Cukor to Annie Hall by Woody Allen, as well as the work of Éric Rohmer [director of My Night at Maud’s]. It’s a genre that allows everything: lightness and musicality, but also an existential premise and deep character work,” says Trier. “It’s the type of cinema that I miss. Today, I see many manufactured, artificial movies. I wanted to simply make a human film, containing the dramas and comedies of life.” For the director, the real theme of the movie is the “ongoing negotiation between our imagined lives, what we had in mind when we were young, and the reality of existence,” including death. “In reality, we don’t have a lot of time ahead of us.”The romantic comedy genre, dismissed for lacking substance, began to decline at the end of the 1990s. Trier blames this demise in mainstream cinema on the “homogeneity of romantic portraits,” which he attributes to the rise of social media. “Facebook and Instagram have limited the representation of the romantic ideal. We see it in the photos of couples with hashtags such as ‘life is good,’ ‘love wins’ or ‘I feel blessed.’ Movies have tried to reproduce this vision, when love is assuredly the most complicated thing that exists,” he says.The Worst Person in the World also addresses one of society’s biggest taboos: adultery. “I think, like British psychoanalyst Adam Phillips, that the monogamous are the real romantic heroes of our time. They are the ones who resist the infinite possibility of swiping [on dating apps] and having sex with a limitless number of people. I did not want to judge that, but the movie talks about loving oneself, more than finding a partner.” The Worst Person in the World also examines the issue of growing up, even if it’s at age 30 or 40. “The classic Bildungsroman coming-of-age stories were about protagonists who were between 16 and 20 years old. Now maturity arrives much later. It’s even possible for us to continually be going through this process. It could be that the definitive step towards maturity doesn’t happen until we are confronted with our own death,” says Trier.The director’s penchant for digression is also rare to find in contemporary cinema, which is guided by linear frameworks with the exception of some filmmakers. “I love directors like Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson and Alain Resnais, who use all possible narrative resources to get to the bottom of what they want to say,” says Trier. “Digression reflects the modern sensibility. I suppose I am the typical post-modern guy who continues to believe that we are fragmented beings. I do everything possible not to focus on the plot. The idea of the plot has taken hold of today’s cinema and television. I love a good detective story, but the narrative can’t dominate everything.”In The Worst Person in the World, Trier breaks up the movie with scenes that aren’t connected with the narrative heart of the film, such as a monologue on the changing nature of culture and the generational differences regarding the #MeToo movement against sexism.There is also a moral dimension to the movie, one that is very particular to a Scandinavian director like Trier and linked to guilt. “Guilt emanates from two aspects. On the one hand, the wealth of Norway, the exemplary image of democratic and economic success of which we are so proud of, although we know it all comes from oil. That explains why I don’t have a driver’s license: it’s a useless gesture, but it’s my way of symbolically channeling it,” says Trier. “Secondly, the legacy of Scandinavian Protestantism, always so virtuous, whose sense of blame I have assimilated despite being a complete atheist.”When it comes to his Oscar chances, Trier says it’s not keeping him awake at night. All signs indicate that the prize will go to Drive My Car. “If it wins, it deserves it. And also Flee, I liked that a lot. It would be fair.” It’s a lesson taught in Norwegian schools: it’s not about winning, it’s all about taking part.English version by Melissa Kitson.'], ['Batman, the superhero defined by neurotic masculinity', '2022-03-10', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-10/batman-the-superhero-defined-by-neurotic-masculinity.html', 'The latest installment of the cinematic saga shows a masked protagonist who shares James Bond’s inability to establish equal relationships with women', 'The opening scenes of The Batman, the latest cinematic take on the DC Comics superhero, show a mysterious figure person spying on the mayor of Gotham City with binoculars. While his behavior is very similar to that of the eponymous character, it is soon revealed that we are watching Enigma, the villain of the film. Comparisons between Batman and his arch enemies are a constant in the stories, but in this delivery, it seems to take a more virulent aspect than the usual. Before the complexities of the world, both Enigma and Batman have built universes suitable for themselves: perverse amusement parks supporting sick yearnings for revenge; the fetishistic use of every kind of gadget; and the impulsive obsession to control Gotham’s people and its architecture.It is no coincidence that the final scenes of director Matt Reeve’s movie offer the superhero a chance to escape these dynamics born out of frustration and the fantasies of power: the dynamics of neurotic masculinity. As Batman observes Catwoman escaping Gotham City from the rearview mirror of his motorbike, he is forced to fix his eyes, perhaps for the first time, on the tangible challenges he has encountered throughout the film. In this sense, The Batman is a film worthy of our time – meaning, as confusing and irregular as it is stimulating in its efforts to put the superhero through deep examination, exposing his immaturity, his inability to think about himself and empathize with his surroundings, and his futile attempts for the evasion of reality through uniforms, masks, and technology.It is worth recalling that a few months ago, 007 was subject to a similar deconstruction in No Time to Die (2021). It is likely that the cinematic Batman – as the comic book Batman has long since transcended this particular debate – and James Bond will reaffirm their essence as super-soldiers in the service of the system in their future adventures. Both represent an archetype with deep sociocultural roots, unalterable despite the illusions of change. But at least a growing self-awareness is noticeable when it comes to the deeper meaning of their disguises, their literal metaphorical masks, and the range of deadly tools that money can afford when it comes to doing good. After all, the homo technologicus played by superheroes and secret agents set the standard for the masculine ever since the age of reason crushed the legitimacy of brute force. From that point, the masculine had to sophisticate its claim to dominate reality under the pretext of honoring the truth and justice that the new social orders seemed to put under threat.The masked vigilante takes over popular culture by seeing everything but the anomalies of his own identity, knowing everything about progress but nothing about its potential to improve his community. Especially when this faces its conversion into mass culture, with copies and imitations reaffirming certain models. Sir Percy Blakeney, alias The Scarlet Pimpernel, a character imagined in 1905 by the novelist and playwright Emma Orczcy, hides under his façade of a dissolute British nobleman, a master of disguise and prodigious swordsman saving French nobles from the French Revolution guillotine. The conservative temper of Orczy’s theatrical work and the many literary sequels is, in fact, traceable in the third and last Batman adventure starring Christian Bale: The Dark Knight Rises (2012); a film that, in the opinion of culture critic Jordi Costa, revealed how far director Christopher Nolan was from sharing the spirit of social movements like the anti-austerity movement (15-M) in Spain or Occupy Wall Street.Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, like Zorro (1919) or The Shadow (1930), draw from the idiosyncrasy of The Scarlet Pimpernel, but also from Sherlock Holmes, the quintessential detective. Arthur Conan Doyle’s character is in no need of a mask, as his heterodox inquiries have never put him at the mercy of public opinion and, also, because his insensitive, sharp-featured and clinical-eyed façade is a mask itself: the denial of emotions favoring an almost divine type of logical thought. Even if under this thinking vibrates a deep alienation and a sense of death transferred to their prey through exercising violence, which is not always physical but, as in the case of Holmes, dialectical.After the Second World War, the archetype shifts, adapting to pop culture times marked by the Cold War, corporate gentrification, and economic and touristic development. In contrast to the gothic romanticism of Batman, the rabid animal trapped in the body of a human being, the ideal moment emerges for James Bond, the wet dream of the average office worker. As much as we may want to stress on his status as a spy in Her Majesty’s Secret Service – as Ian Fleming, his creator refrained from doing so – Bond is a civil servant, an enforcer without conscience. A gray character that does not create either his fancy suits or the inventions he uses to escape or finish his enemies. Bond is the ideal technocrat, a skilled manager of the chain of command who does not need a mask, considering his face and eyes are nothing but a blank canvas… Thanks to No Time to Die, 60 years after Dr. No (1962), we have finally had the opportunity to witness some of Bond’s private sphere, as opposed to the importance the fortresses of solitude have in the universes of Batman and Holmes, from which they prepare their assaults on the simulation of civilization.However, Batman and Bond share something important: the inability to establish equal relationships with women, camouflaged by the first with an attitude of insufferable patriarchal severity and, by the second, under the disrespectful Casanova attitude. Fortunately, the female characters of both sagas have somewhat been showing film by film that they have discovered these men’s true colors. It seems no coincidence that Bruce Wayne in The Batman and James Bond in No Time to Die remain trapped within their playgrounds, while the female characters dare to explore the other possibilities of fiction.'], ['Shackleton’s legendary ‘Endurance’: One of polar exploration’s most famous vessels located in Antarctica', '2022-03-10', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-10/shackletons-legendary-endurance-one-of-polar-explorations-most-famous-vessels-located-in-antarctica.html?autoplay=1', 'The ship went down in the Weddell Sea in 1915 after being trapped in pack ice for nine months, leading to a celebrated escape to safety over land and sea', 'A scientific expedition working aboard a South African ice-breaker, the Agulhas II, has discovered the Endurance, arguably the most famous vessel in the history of polar exploration, whose name has gone down in the history alongside the Fram, the Terra Nova, the Discovery, and the Erebus and Terror – the doomed ships of Captain Sir John Franklin’s expedition, of which there were no survivors. The Endurance was located in the Weddell Sea, the gateway to the Antarctic, at a depth of 3,000 meters, not far from where the crew recorded its last coordinates before it was claimed by the depths on November 21, 1915, crushed by the pack ice in which it had been trapped for almost a year. The 28-strong crew of the Endurance was saved by their courage and determination, and the bold response to the disaster of the expedition’s leader, Sir Ernest Shackleton, with his men stranded in one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet. Their subsequent escape is considered one of the greatest feats of the age of Antarctic exploration and one that honored the name of their stricken vessel.The captain of the Endurance, Frank Worsley, took careful measurements with his sextant and chronometer of the location where the ice engulfed the ship, while the photographer of the expedition Frank Hurley documented the ponderous advance of the ice floe on the structure of the Endurance, rescuing around 150 negatives that tell the tale of the ship’s final repose. The vessel and its contents are a designated monument under the international Antarctic Treaty and as such its discoverers can observe, but not disturb the wreck in any way. What was unknown previously was where the current had dragged the Endurance. As it turns out, 107 years after it sank the vessel was located around 4.6 miles from the coordinates recorded by Worsley. That may seem a small distance in terms of land, but in the frozen expanse of the Weddell Sea and under the difficult conditions posed by the Antarctic, finding the Endurance was no mean feat.The Agulhas II was on a research mission to the Larsen ice shelf during which it also took the opportunity to search for the Endurance, combing a predetermined area with remote-controlled submersibles, which were able to send back photographs of the ship. The “noble, courageous and gutsy little boat,” as the crew described it in its final moments, stands proudly upright on the sea bed, with its name still resplendent on its stern. There is no sign of the blue ensign Shackleton hoisted before the ice finished its work, but in the immense deep of the Antarctic abyss we can almost hear the echo of the spirited send-off given to the Endurance by her crew, who watched her go down with three “hurrahs.”The explorers later recounted that shortly before the Endurance was lost to sight, a curious visit occurred: a group of eight Emperor penguins solemnly approached the trapped vessel, gazed intensely upon it and, lifting their heads, let out a phantasmal cry.All of this forms part of the legend of the Endurance, which was built in Norway as a cruise ship for Arctic sightseers and for hunting trips. Shackleton acquired the vessel for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, the objective of which was to complete the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent via the South Pole, which had been reached in 1911 by Roald Amundsen. Shackleton described the challenge as the “one great main object of Antarctic journeyings,” and saw its success as a means of redeeming British polar exploration after the heroic failure of Robert Falcon Scott’s 1912 expedition.The expedition departed under ill omens: the First World War had just broken out and Shackleton offered the Endurance to the Royal Navy to fight Germany instead of the Antarctic pack ice. The ship eventually reached the sea ice around the frozen continent in December 1914 and after navigating almost 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) of treacherous ocean it became completely trapped just 85 miles (137 kilometers) short of its destination, Vahsel Bay, in the Weddell Sea, on January 19, 1915. The Endurance would move no more under its own steam, pulled and pushed about instead by the ice floe. For nine months, Shackleton and his men viewed their predicament with cool optimism, but this evaporated when they realized that the ice was not going to break open. The expedition leader observed: “No ship made by man can resist such pressure.”Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship and the crew embarked on a march across the unstable ice towards safety, which lay over 300 miles (500 kilometers) away. Before departing, the explorers, who had been camping on the ice a stone’s throw from the Endurance, removed everything that could prove useful and transportable from the ship, including the famous 22.5-foot lifeboat the James Caird, which would serve to save their lives and which they dragged across the ice. What may well still remain on the wreck of the Endurance is the remainder of the crew’s Encyclopaedia Britannica, of which they carried with them just two volumes to stave off boredom.Before setting off, the expedition members watched the Endurance sink, at night. “It is hard to write what I feel,” Shackleton noted in his diary. “To a sailor, his ship is more than a floating home. Now, straining and groaning, her timbers cracking and her wounds gaping, she is slowly giving up her sentient life at the very outset of her career.” Another crew member noted that the sound of the ice breaking the ship’s hull “seem as though they are the cries of a living creature.”The morning after the Endurance went down, Shackleton gave the order to lighten the loads the men would be forced to carry. Shackleton himself left a handful of gold coins, his watch, his silver brushes, his vanity case and a Bible that had been presented to the ship by Queen Alexandra, saving just a few pages of psalms and some verses from the Book of Job, the recital of which did not exactly lighten the march and which sounded like an epitaph to the Endurance: “Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.”Even more depressing for the crew was the necessity of killing several of the ship’s animals: sleigh dogs and the unfortunate Mrs Chippy, a cat belonging to the ship’s carpenter Harry McNish. When the crew set off, they went through a genuine ordeal on the unforgiving ice. It was a journey that lent credence to an observation made by Apsley Cherry-Garrard, a survivor of the Terra Nova expedition and author of The Worst Journey in the World, who remarked that polar exploration was the most radical and solitary way to have a terrible time that he had ever conceived. The crew of the Endurance, however, would all live to tell their tale.Slowly the march advanced until they reached Elephant Island. From there, Shackleton and five others sailed the tiny James Caird in an epic 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) journey to South Georgia, where they arranged a rescue party for their comrades. Through his spirited command, which prevented the crew from giving up hope, and by refusing to sacrifice his men for the achievement of the objective as Scott had done, Shackleton has gone down in history as a noble example of leadership.The Endurance was discovered just a few weeks after another legendary vessel was located: Captain James Cook’s Endeavour, and the 2014 and 2016 finds of Franklin’s Erebus and Terror in Canadian waters, some 170 years after they set sail from England in 1845. Fridtjof Nansen and Amundsen’s Fram, meanwhile, is perfectly preserved and can be visited in its own museum in Oslo.English version by Rob Train.'], ['‘Deep Water,’ an erotic, toxic and implausible thriller with Ana de Armas and Ben Affleck', '2022-03-23', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-23/deep-water-an-erotic-toxic-and-implausible-thriller-with-ana-de-armas-and-ben-affleck.html', 'The leading couple are in the hands of octogenarian director Adrian Lyne in this new adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel', '“Ben Affleck is to good acting what a cooked pickle is to haute cuisine.” It’s hard not to recall this joke by Spanish movie critic Antonio Gasset when watching the American actor and his deer-in-the-headlights expression in Deep Water.The film, which stars Affleck alongside Cuban-American actress Ana de Armas, is directed by British director Adrian Lyne, 81, the man behind some of the most toxic and ridiculous blockbuster films of the 1980s and 1990s. From Fatal Attraction to Indecent Proposal or Nine and a Half Weeks, all of Lyne’s movies are based on the tired formula of “sex sells.” In these films, Hollywood stars play rich, boring and often cringe-worthy characters – serving more as adornments in pseudo-erotic plots. Two decades after Unfaithful, in which Lyne presents his moralizing vision of adultery, the director returns to the same tacky universe, where undaunted men fall in the throes of supposed femme fatales dressed in fine lingerie.Deep Water is based on Patricia Highsmith’s novel by the same name and was adapted by French director Michel Deville in the 1980s with actors Isabelle Huppert and Jean-Louis Trintignant in the lead roles. The movie focuses on a married couple in an open relationship riddled with tension. It’s the kind of couple that may have existed in the backward bourgeoise of yesteryear, but who are completely implausible today.Ana de Armas plays a young wife and mother who doesn’t like being either. To entertain herself, in addition to drinking the water out of the vases, she cheats on her husband with every young man who crosses her path. The couple sleeps in separate beds and the husband, who neither works nor needs to after inventing a drone that made him a millionaire, doesn’t seem to mind his wife’s dalliances. But she is annoyed by both her husband and their daughter. So why do they stay together? This is just one issue in a long list of questions and inconsistencies that are left unaddressed. But, in the end, it is almost better not to know.Lyne tries to turn jealousy into an aphrodisiac elixir, and maybe that makes some sense for an 81-year-old man who found success in a cinematic genre that today is just fatuous, out-of-date and toxic.'], ['Rosalía slaps down prejudices on ‘Motomami,’ a record that’s as chaotic as it is exciting', '2022-03-18', 'https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-18/rosalia-slaps-down-prejudices-on-motomami-a-record-thats-as-chaotic-as-it-is-exciting.html', 'In an act of total artistic freedom, the Spanish singer breaks down the barriers between genres on her new release, directly addressing her detractors ', 'There is a song on Rosalía’s newly released album, Motomami, where the Spanish sensation sums up what could be described as “Rosalía’s world.” “I’m just as much a flamenco singer in a Versace tracksuit as I am dressed as a dancer. / And while they talk about me behind my back, I bring out my anger with every little stab… I am who I am. / God bless Pastori and Mercé, Lil’ Kim, Tego and M.I.A., my family and freedom.”The verse is a direct response to the debate that the Barcelona-born singer-songwriter sparks, and reflects the strengths of her narrative. It’s a lack of musical prejudice above all else: the flamenco of Niña Pastor, the empowered rap of Lil’ Kim, the experimental nature of M.I.A. and the reggaeton of Tego Caldreón.The song in question, Bulerías, has the clearest flamenco influence on the album, and this is no coincidence – that was the genre that catapulted her to fame in 2017 with her debut release, Los Ángeles. Nor is it an accident that when she sings “I am who I am,” the autotune kicks in, a direct response to those who can’t tolerate her mashing up of different cultural styles.We can safely say that Motomami is not El Mal Querer, her previous record that came out in 2018. But that is not important. Where that record was filled with Lorcian symbolism, drama and angst within an ideological narrative of love and feminine strength, in this release there is uproar, fun, reggaeton, chaos, mischief and the breaking down of borders between musical genres. This is no small achievement. The record also manages to portray the state of mind of the singer, who has one foot firmly planted in the United States, often spends time in Latin America, has a Puerto Rican boyfriend (Rauw Alejandro, a reggaeton star), glamorous friendships, and enviable photos on her Instagram account…On Motomami, a one-minute song that seems to have been recorded by the sound engineer’s nephew during a coffee break actually counted on the input of 14 different people and saw the inside of three different studios. The whole record benefits from the talent she is able to assemble – Pharrell Williams, James Blake and The Weeknd, for example – which helps the end result to be something of a patchwork, without the unifying strength of El Mal Querer.There are 16 songs, for a total of 42 minutes, but only two tracks that are longer than four minutes. Most are somewhere between 2.30m and 3m, the estimated time, according to the gurus of the new pop, for listeners not to get bored.Despite all of this, it’s still a solvent and exciting record, because it takes risks, reformulates styles and gets the right result. Rosalía is more interested in breaking down barriers than just crossing them. This is good news for those who try but fail to do this with reggaeton. Rosalía, however, manages to squeeze the genre, adding the depth of flamenco, modernizing it with saturated electronica and turning it into something different.Her immersion in American culture results in a mix of English phrases and slang, but that just serves to enrich the discourse. There’s humor and hedonism on the record, because Rosalía appears to be the only person in this world who, after a night of partying, can get up without a hangover and enjoy a romantic breakfast. That’s just what her life is like right now.The feeling that you are left with after listening to Motomami is that anything is possible with this artist, and that whatever she comes up with next will be just stimulating and that she could well record something as sublime as El Mal Querer at any time. If the essence of music is freedom, there is no other global star who is as creatively free as she is right now. That’s the luck she has of being Spanish…English version by S. H.']]\n"
